sash076,Nice hotel- vistited during Ramadan,"I arrived early hours of the morning and check in was good the staff was polite and nice, they offered us to upgrade our room due to it being Ramadan and the hotel being quite empty. The room was beautiful especially the bathroom, nice and spacious also very clean. The pool area was nice and the pool was nice and clean, we were able to get sun beds but doubt you would be able to if the hotel had more people, I think they need to invest in some more. Visiting in Ramadan can make your stay a little hard your not allowed to eat, drink or smoke in public places so going down to the beach in 43 degree heat without a drink is pretty intense. You are allowed to drink around the pool but the pool bar is not open during the day. Also your allowed to eat during the day in your hotel only. The hotel is right next to a metro station which makes getting around Dubai really easy. When I was travelling to Dubai the one question I kept looking for was how much to take, you can make Dubai as cheap or expensive as you like you will spend most of your money on drinks. Excursions are quite expensive but we took 1000 and it was plenty we even came home with some. On arrival to the hotel you will have to pay 20 dirhams per night per room as city tax so ensure you put that in your budget. Also ladies be careful on what you pack, ensure you are dressed appropriately while in dubai. (Dresses to knees or lower and covering shoulders etc) We stayed up on the 50th floor so the view was lovely, I'd recommend going higher up only downside is the lifts can be so slow! I think this hotel was lovely and would recommend it.",07-Jun-17,"London, United Kingdom",not fake

PKBhakat,Nice Location and awesome rooms,"While arriving at the Hotel we were unhappy to see lot of renovation work happening at the entrance and reception route was diverted. The check in time also took more than 20+ minutes even though there was no rush.But when we allotted a room at 48th floor with a sparkling view of city, we felt very happy. Room was spacious with everything we needed. However, during 2 days of our stay we felt that even though staffs are good and polite, there is no mechanism to ensure customer request on priority. When we were going out we placed ñmake my roomî button ON, however the rooms was not cleaned. Even after when we came back in the evening the room condition was AS IT IS. Therefore, after follow up 3-4 times finally the room was cleaned next day. Apart from this particular incident we did not find any issues with this hotel. Overall it was very good stay.The hotel is located next to Emirates Tower Metro station and everything is nearby. So you will have plenty of options for travel mode. I recommend this hotel for both leisure and business travels.Overall: 4/5Location: 5/5Ambiance: 4/5Room & Bathrooms: 4.5/5Amenities: 4/5Restaurant & Food: 4/5Service: 3/5Value for money: 4/5",05-Jun-17,"Pune, India",not fake

TravellerG26,Very Good Hotel but not Fully 5*,"I stayed at Millennium Plaza Hotel Dubai for a week in February. I was on holidays in Dubai, travelled with some of my family members.My overall impression about this hotel is very good. One of the main reasons why we chose this hotel was its location - it's on Sheikh Zayed Road in relatively central place and Emirates Towers metro station is just several steps from the entrance of the hotel. Also, there are many restaurants around the hotel so plenty of places to choose for lunch or dinner from.The hotel has a swimming pool on the roof of the garage. The swimming pool is really big.Room in the hotel was nice and tidy. Since we stayed on 48th floor, the view from the room was great. The minor disadvantage for me was that windows in the room could not be opened at all as I like to have some fresh air in the room. I do not know though, maybe non-openable windows are common in very high skyscrapers. On the other hand, air recuperation system in the room worked really well, just it made the room too cold to keep it turned on at night.Breakfast was excellent. Broad choice and the quality of food was great too. Fresh juice was provided every day.We did not communicate too much with the reception staff but they seemed polite and professional.The question might happen why I do not give this hotel excellent rating, only very good. First of all, the shower was awfully leaking. Each time we took shower, we had to put towels on the ground in the bathroom as water was everywhere. Several times I nearly fell down on the wet and therefore very slippery floor. I think showers should be definitely fixed. Also, although I had my own hairdryer, once I checked the one that was in the room and its wires looked dangerously naked at some parts. I do not think that 5* hotel should place broken hairdryers in the rooms. It's not even safe. Moreover, several times shower kit (shower gel etc.) were not supplemented although it was obvious that we were running out of them.Because of the disadvantages mentioned above, I rate this hotel only as very good, but not excellent. I like this hotel in general and would most likely come back but I have to admit it is not fully 5* hotel.",02-Jun-17,"Vilnius, Lithuania",not fake

cesar a,10 days for business,"I had a 10 day business stay Millennium Plaza. Staff are wonderful, their new renovated lobby is much better then the old (I arrived when they switched). The room was large and the view from the room was nice from the 44th floor. ever.For a quick staycation or for business a good health club facility is a must. A great way to relax, stay fit and pamper yourself. The gym facility was well equipped and had a personal trainer, Marina. I did about 6 training sessions with her and I'm really happy about it. The Classes are very challenging and loved how I felt after each workout! She is very professional, full of knowledge, dedicated to clients... She is just awesome!",02-Jun-17,N/A,not fake

Stadtkind83,Definitely no 5 Star Hotel,"Rooms were not ready at 3:30 p.m. . We had to wait for about 45 minutes in the lobby were are constructions ongoing at the moment. All public areas seem to need a renovation. There are scratches an the walls, dirt stains on the carpest... Also the rooms were not in ""5 star condition"". Bedclothes with cracks and holes, dust and crumbs allover the room. Breakfast was a average 3 star business hotel buffet and the service staff was completely overchallenged. I really do not want to sound overcriticall, but I do expect much more, if a hotel is categorized as 5 star venue!",02-Jun-17,"Mainz, Germany",not fake

Alexandra D,Be carefull at the swimmingpool,"I booked this hotel for 2 nights on my way back from Thailand to France. I arrived at 13h and of course the room was not ready, and i had to wait until exactly 14h for a room. They gave me an upgrade, which was nice. The room was great, only the electric kettle was not working. I asked to change it, and i had to wait until the next day before it was done. The swimmingpool was nice, but dangerous. It is on the 12th floor, and i was so unlucky my parasol catched the wind. It landed on top of me. The pool crew quickly responded and gave me ice. The called the manager and his response was to sit that close to a parasol. No excuses or anything like that. The pain did not go away with the ice, so i asked the congierge for help. They bring me to the pharmacy for some cream. I asked if the hotel was paying for it, but they say they cannot (insurance, doctor, ...). So they offered to pay my taxi to the airport. The next day when i was leaving, of course the congierge of the day before was not there (although he promissed) and the manager was nowhere to be found. And this congierge was not aware. Took him 15 min to finally approve my taxi. Now 1 week later, i still have the bruises. At least the pain is finally gone. Still waiting for a kind word from the hotel. But i think that is too much to ask",02-Jun-17,N/A,not fake

Sof N,"Beautiful hotel rooms, lovely service, great location","We had a wonderful weekend stay in this hotel.The hotel staff were exceptional, especially Faiz, who gave us such a warm welcome and was excited to let us know we had a beautiful room on the 51st floor! This was great because it gave us a great view of the Burj Khalifa and cancelled any traffic noise.The room was extremely clean and well equipped, bathroom was gorgeous and the bed so comfortable!The location of the hotel is great, the metro station is literally at the front of the building which beats traffic and Dubai parking easily! The only downside to the location was that it was a little tricky to find the valet and front door but you can follow the signs if you know to look for them.The pool was again, not super convenient but nice and relaxing when we got up there. Comfy sun beds and plenty of them to go around, towels provided and relaxing background music.The thing that topped off our stay was the lovely gesture from the hotel in giving us a surprise ""Happy Anniversary"" cake which was waiting for us in our room when we returned on the first evening and was delicious! This was not requested and was such a nice surprise, the hotel really went above and beyond and we'd happily stay there again!",01-Jun-17,N/A,not fake

hhakim,Second stay as good as the First stay,"This is our second stay at the hotel. The first time was back in November 2016.The hotel is located on the Sheikh Zayed Road, which is one of the main roads in Dubai. There's a Dubai Metro station (Emirates Towers station - Red Line) right in front of the hotel, which is a huge convenience. It's only 2 stops towards the UAE Exchange station if you want to go to the Dubai Mall / Burj Khalifa. Pretty much, staying at this hotel gives you the flexibility to take either the metro or taxi to get to your destinations. Fyi - there's a taxi stop at the trunk road right in front of the hotel as well.From the airport you have the option to take the metro to right in front of the hotel which will only cost you 8 Dirham (normal fare). If by taxi, the cost will be between 30 to 35 dirham. If you plan to take the metro to the hotel, make sure you take the GOLD class (I'm not sure of the fare, but definitely much cheaper than taxi). This is because you will have space and comfort especially with the luggage. The normal class is just pack with passengers. The hotel lobby is currently undergoing a major renovation - expected to finish around end of June 2017. So, you will have to access from the rear entrance. Not that of an inconvenience as it's just a very short walk toward the back of the hotel. The room is very modern, clean, well maintained with new furniture & comfy bed. The bed/pillows are comfortable. The bathroom is big with separate shower & toilet with a good size bath tub. If you stay here, please request for the city view - as high as possible. The sea view was not good at all.Breakfast buffet was good with many selection of different kind of food. The hotel staff is very helpful. I believe this hotel is well worth it for the price that we pay considering the location in the city with multiple transportation options right in front of the hotel, the quality of service & the quality of the room.",01-Jun-17,Malaysia,not fake

Good views of the port and if you had good vision could see part of the world too!Room was made up every day and complimentary bottled water left each day. Although not huge, the pool area was nice and kept clean. Yes, there was work happening in the reception, hence why we may have got a good room rate but it didn't affect us at all and the reception was still clean despite the work. If i went to Dubai again, the hotel would definitely be up for consideration to stay there again.",2 weeks ago,Sutton Coldfield,not fake

Got a free upgrade and was given a corner room over looking the SZR and Burj khalifa on the 40tg floor. The rooms were quite big and the staff and service was great as well. All the staff member are friendly. The infinity pool is on the 12th floor of the adjacent building. The taste buffet breakfast could definitely be improved. For the price I Payed for this hotel I received amazing service and the view was just mesmerising that you can admire it the whole day. The reception of the hotel is under renovation and they have made a new reception at the back side which is now the entry and exit point of the Hotel, to be frank the new reception is quite small and no where near the 5 star standard. Also this is mainly a business Hotel. The hotel starts from 26th floor upto 64th I guess.

Sher C,Amazing Experience,"My friend and i arrived at Dubai International airport around 3.30 am. it was 30 degrees on arrival and we were really tired after a 7 hour flight. However; outside of the airport there was lots of taxi available. We tried to ascertain the difference in prices between and encountered verbal abuse. Concerned we readily agreed to the abusive drivers cab to prevent a scene.We were grateful to reach the hotel quickly, after experiencing an abrupt and abusive taxi driver. We were both happy to be greeted by such a polite young Ugandan man called James. James welcomed us to the Millennium Plaza Hotel and introduced himself with a genuine smile on his face, before leading us to the reception desk. We explained our initial reception at the airport and without hesitation James apologized on behalf of the taxi driver and verbally consoled us for our experience. James walked us through the checking in, process before leading us to our room which was on the 47th Floor. On entry James showed us how to operate the air conditioning and all the mod cons in the room. He also showed us how to use the internal telephone in order to access room service and the magazines that showed sights and clubs in Dubai. James also explained the location of the hotel's restaurant, spa, gym and the infinity pool. Tipping James was a pleasure as he really put himself out to accommodate us. James, really was a breath of fresh air despite the 30 degrees. Prior to leaving for our trip we researched on Trip Adviser the review of the hotel and i have to say i had reservations. However; our experience of the staff and, cleanliness of the hotel was amazingly perfect. The view from our room was amazing we really felt special thanks to the staff. I would re-book without any hesitation.Thank you to all the staff at the Millennium Plaza Hotel for making our first stay in Dubai an amazing experience. You deserve the five star rating. Special thank you again to James for a beautiful initial reception, that you upheld through out our stay. at the Millennium Plaza Hotel.",3 weeks ago,"London, England, United Kingdom",not fake

The check in agent asked if we would want a smoking or non-smoking room. We asked for a non-smoking room. His response was, I can have a smoking room with two single beds ... strange as this was the opposite of what I had requested , so i laughed a littleHe was deadly serious! I explained that I wasnt a smoker and had no desire to stay in a smoking room, also I was there to celebrate my first weddinng anniversary so two single beds wouldnt cut it!He then said he was able to arrange for early check in for a non-smoking premium room with a double bed if i Paid for an ipgrade. if not, i would have to check in at the normal time and take the smoking twin roomI was absolute furious and surpirsed at the general lack of coutesy and desire to sell and make money.

The reception area is under renovation but didn't seem to interrupt check in.We had a great view down Sheik Zayeed road from our room, especially at night with all the lights.The spa provides a good service and offers a discount for multiple treatments.The pool area is good and the food offered there is excellent. However the view isn't all that great compared to other Dubai hotels.The housekeeping lets this hotel down. The wall next to the toilet had stains, the room wasn't vacuumed all week, nor the bathroom floor cleaned, the towels were ropey and the hospitality tray wasn't replenished, we had to ask for milk, tea etc. Then the next day they removed it all again.The exec area lacked atmosphere, it's bland and the offerings are nothing special.Breakfast is busy, there doesn't seem to be enough staff to clear up. The food is ok, nothing special. All in all this is ok as a one stop business hotel but doesn't compare to other hotels I've stayed at in Dubai.",4  weeks ago,"hertfordshirehertfordshire",not fake

Inspector G,Never again,"As i am hotelier, i was so suprised with this hotel get this good point. We stayed at this hotel for 1 week. I will never chooese this hotelk again. Since we get very bad service.As specialy reception guys were worst receptionist, I have ever seen.I just remember the Faiz,he never smiles and so ruda as like all of them that I did not remember their names.First you( 2 receptions did) can not call your guest by just their names, we are not your friends! As I call you ï Mr./ Ms ƒ ï Second you can not cut my conversation while I was speaking and tell me ï ListenÍ Third if there is a problem with my reservationYou must order something for your guest. Reservation problem should be solved with agency that you are working. Fifht I neve waste 1,5 half hour for c in at any hotel. Sixth if a guest has c/in and c/out( I have 2 reservations back to back) you do c/in _ c/out , you do not call guest to reception and say you have to c/out,Seven once you can give wrong key but to not 3 times since you lifts never enough for this hotel. Eight you charge 600AED for empyt minibar ? and i never know why minibar was empty.Second worst thing about hotel is lifts, You wait min 10 minutes any time, breakfast time min 20 minutes.Breakfast was very poor, if something finished you have to wait a lot. Kristin (girl at breakfast) was moody,one day she was kind done day so surly.We always wait for tea. She said ïtea is finished- i will bring oneÍ everday same speech.if you see that guests are waiting you need to add New staff. Housekeeping doping well, pool is small and Black, its the first time i have seen that pool is black Stoned. Should be blue to see the clean.Lobby smells really bad, because of under constricton. internet was very slow. You can not get cold water from tap, hot water comes from both side of tap.3 Things good about this hotel is concierge departmant, that the guys does great job(Lalit, Zubair, Sammy) Security/ Housekeeping doping well and locaiton just at the emirates tower metro station",05-May-17,"Istanbul, Turkey",not fake

There is a valet parking, very effective.Hotel staff is very friendly, check in / check out process is going fast and smoothly. These are the positive sides, but there are few negatives that guides me to give a low score:The common areas are not as per a 5 star hotel. The rooms are OK, our room (we stayed 4 days) had the first 2 days a bad odor, may be room has not been used for many days. The fridge had to be replaced, as was not cooling.

I have suggested that a warning should be posted inside every room or (easier for everybody) that the lockout system should be cancelled !That apart, the pool is a joy and the choices at the breakfast buffet are many and varied.",02-May-17,"Harrow, UK",not fake

Slow lifts and long queue for it after breakfast. Shampoo's, conditioners and body products were not changed or topped up once during my stay which is a shame. One hair cap during my stay which is not doable for a woman with long hair. I did have my own products just in case i didnt like theirs, but once i used the hotel ones they were never replaced. The rooms were very noisy.

bel3ms,best value for money and best experience,"we stayed in this hotel from april 12 to 16 over the holy week holidays. I only have very good things to say about the hotel. Checked in evening of april 12, I do not recall the name but the gentleman who checked us in explained everything in detail, offered breakfast explained if we reserved ahead of the day the price is better. He is a slim, tall south Asian man who had no beard or moustache ( I cannot recall his name but he is definitely a very good front office guy). we saw him again on the 3rd day as we were on our way to an afternoon tour he smiled and waved at me. my cousin said that's great people are friendly here. when we checked out the front office personnel who handled us was a Filipino who was also very efficient and manage our billing. I did not manage to meet the front office manager. If I did, would have said that the selection of front desk personnel in this hotel, the quality of English they speak, the friendliness and level of service is excellent. the breakfast buffet, we only took 2 was worth the cost and selection was good. food was delicious and the fruits were fresh and particularly sweet. the housekeeping is efficient although standards for replacing amenities could be more consistent. one item to improve may be a description of what the bidet/wash bowl located beside the toilet. during our visit to the mosque I learned that moslem women use this to wash themselves in preparation for prayers. please put a signage explaining this on the wall so that people who are now aware of the practice understand what its for. overall, if I get the opportunity to return to Dubai. I will still stay in this hotel!!!!",28-Apr-17,"Manila, Philippines",not fake

Zafer B,Needs to improve,"I would like to share my special thanks to concierge departmant, that the guys does great job, Lalit, Zubair, Sammy, James.... if you ask something, they inform you or they do more than your request. This is the only thing that I was happy for this hotel. The view is good to see the Dubai.We have stayed 5 nights end of april, first of all the reception staff is really needs to be polite and helpfull. They do not listen you, they want you to listen themselves. They made many mistakes, find the reservation, confused, wrong dates, wrong Keys...if you have a key that doesn't work, you need to come down from 52 th floor to reception and may take 15 minutes, not kidding, and waiting at reception for New key, go up 15 minutes again.... Breakfast and the restaurant is the one of the worst place for this hotel, very old furnitured, buffet was poor, its not really easy to have a cup of tea, this is Managers problems, if you see that guests are waiting you need to add New staff. There is no small spoon at restaurant for your tea or coffee, please see the photo. Housekeeping doping well, pool is small and Black, its the first time i have seen that pool is black Stoned. Should be blue to see the clean. Minibar is empty but still they charge you a deposit. Hotel has a good location, just at the emirates tower metro station.

helenemoscow,well located hotel for business travel,"the Millennium Plaza, is a huge hotel, rooms are well appointed, but the air conditioning cannot be switched off and is rather cold, so if you like a cosy room, this is not the one for you. The staff are very friendly and helpful, but there is only one food outlet on the 5th Floor and it is quite hard to get there as the lifts are very busy, so it is not easy to move around. there is no cafe at the reception, so not really a place you can hand out in, but well located for the business travel, there is a metro station, literally as you leave the hotel, so convenient and a good range hotel", 23 April 2017,"Moscow, Russia",not fake

TPK751,"not bad but, mixed feeling.","The hotel is a very tall building along Sheikh Zayed road, not so far from the famous Burj Khalifa.It is extremely conveniently located right in front of a metro station, within short walking distance to fast-foods and a supermarket.The entrance is quite unusual.As the metro entrance is taking a lot of space along SZR, there is no space for pickup / offloading. Therefore, what is usually the front entrance is really not obvious.CHECK-IN.The lobby is nice, even if it is supposed to be under renovation. Several stylish sofas allow your party to wait comfortably.There was only one staff when we arrived and we had to wait for 10 minutes. This can happen. What happened next is less acceptable.First, the receptionist talked very fast in an english with a strong expat accent. Spending the majority of my time in the UAE, I consider myself at ease with subcontinent or asian accent. But this time, I had to ask many times to repeat what the receptionist was saying. He is probably repeating the same things all day long, but, it's a hospitality business here : he should have understood that I had difficulties understanding and talk much slower. Quite rapidly, I stopped asking to repeatslowly, considering that what he was saying was the usual hotel narrative anyway.Then, non-smoking room was not available, though I called ahead to confirm my reservation. Not acceptable, but it was only for two nights anyway, so, I didn't insist.Finally, he gave us a non-smoking room saying ""we upgraded you"". As a seasoned traveler spending close to 100 nights per year in hotels, I expected nothing from salesmen formulas like these (""it's a very good choice"", ""it has the best view"", etc), and my mood was broken anyway.The hallway at each floor is U-shaped, with the elevator at one end. If you happen to be on the other end (room 4 or 5), you'll have to walk longer.In our way, we found an unmanned vacuum cleaner ... which stayed there all night until 8h30 the next morning ...Anyway, once in the room at a lower floor (hotel occupies from 26F to 64F), we do what is the most important life-saving maneuver : connect to WiFi.As said before, WiFi is an extreme disappointment.1/ it is charged. 20AED for 24H2/ it is only for 2 devices concurrently.3/ you have to logout manually.4/ we had to find out by ourselves how to logout.Sorry Millenium, these WiFi issues are a big no-no.This said, the room itself was spacious (upgraded, hugh ?).Be careful while inserting the card key once inside the room. The slot is very close to the DND/clean touch buttons. You can very easily activate one of them without noticing. (see photo)Our room was facing SZR in the lower floors, but we were not disturbed, as noise is filtered.The room is separated in two by a turnable 31in flat TV : bed area and living area.The furniture of the living area include two one-person sofa with a small table and a writing desk (1m50 x 60cm) with its chair.Most part of the room has a carpet floor.We found the bed a little soft, but still OK.BATHROOMThe particularity of this bathroom is the wood panel shutters separating from the room. This is probably the response to the transparent bathroom trend of this last decade. When the shutters are open, there is nothing to separate from the room, not even a glass panel ... Quite unusual.Otherwise, the shower is the now-standard rainshower type.Shampoo and shower gel are a brand : ""Marie Danielle made in Italy"".Two issues with the bathroom :1) there were what looked like tabacco burns inside the bath ... (how come ?!?)2) no way to turn off the bathroom light. The touch switch outside the bathroom didn't work, nor did the switch next to the bed. We had to sleep with lights in our eyes piercing directly through the wooden shutters.Amenities include :> small fridge, but no drinks inside (??), though the usual coffee/tea set is here at no charge.> safe, which didn't work (error message when trying to set the passcode) and with buttons almost unreadable> iron board + iron, hair dryer, weight scaleBREAKFAST at the 5th floor.That's another big disappointment. It's a huge noisy factory on weekends.First surprise : we have to put our signature on the client list. There may be some bad experience behind this measure, but, in this privacy sensitive world, we are no more accustomed to see our names at plain sight ...Second surprise : the room is U-shaped, and you are unlucky if you find a seat at the other end ...Third surprise : there is no ambiance & noticeable decoration at all. It's just a plain room. No theme, which is quite surprising as this is supposed to be a restaurant for lunch and dinner.Anyway, we found all the basic foods, including the omelet station with a long queue. Nothing particular to say therefore, except that bread offer is insufficient.POOL :Usually, pools in the UAE are confined at the rooftop. They are therefore rather small, with little space between long chairs.Here, the pool is on the parking building next door, accessible by bridge at 5F floor (same floor as restaurant) which brings you to the 8th floor of the parking building.It's a nice place with a large area to dine and have a drink.The infinity pool itself is suitable for relaxing (but not exercising).There's an outside Jacuzzi in one corner (not working while we visited), and a small toddlers paddling pool in the other corner (0,65m deep), surrounded by close to 30 long chairs, and watched by a life guard.Five external showers, but, strangely no changing room.HEALTH CLUB :It is located one floor below the pool. As the door was closed and the atmosphere was not really welcoming, we didn't go in.TO SUM UP.It's a quite a decent offer for a very affordable price, which probably explains the good reviews here. Nevertheless, I can't recommend it to business people, as the sum of glitches makes it not very acceptable, the first and not the least being the WiFi issue.We also tried Grand Millenium which was a little better. Not the same class though.",23-Apr-17,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",not fake

andy2581,No personality,"I was disappointed by this hotel, having read many of the reviews for it and noted its 5-star status. Good things: nice staff who upgraded me to a room on the 60th floor, when the only space they had elsewhere was in smoking rooms. The room itself was fine, with a very comfy bed, fast internet, nice shower and good view out to sea.Bad things: the lack of a proper entrance to the hotel, and the lobby area in general (which I understand is in the process of getting renovated.) It always seemed busy and chaotic, almost like a public/loading area with many people passing through - it just did not have the ambient feel of a hotel at all. There was also heavy renovation going on in many other parts of the hotel, including my floor (but to be fair I couldn't hear it inside my room which was perfectly peaceful.) I also thought the pool area was very average and non-atmospheric, with unnecessarily loud music blaring out. As many people have mentioned, the lifts are extremely frustrating. They're small, there aren't enough of them and they get full up very quickly; if you're on a high floor, be prepared for it to take up to 10 minutes each way for you to get up and down.Overall I wouldn't recommend this hotel, it's definitely not 5-star. If you're looking for somewhere with much more personality and atmosphere, try the Dusit Thani 10 minutes down the road. I had an event there and was jealous!",21-Apr-17,London,not fake

Zainal143,Probably wouldn't return even if it was free,"When I first checked in ( I requested a none smoking room due to my sinus condition) I was informed that for the room type I booked smoking was the only available option and that if I wanted a none smoking room I had to pay extra for an upgrade. I felt like I was being backed into a corner and forced to pay extra. After discussions with their staff they were able to find me a none smoking room and gave me an upgrade.When I went to the room it was not cleaned propely, the furniture was very dated and the sofas were heavily stained. I immediately called house keeping to have it properly cleaned up - to give them credit they were in my room within the next five minutes. The business lounge is actually in their club lounge, so it was somewhat difficult to focus with all the families and kids around.Their elevators were a nightmare, you have to wait over 5 -7 minutes for it to come and it would stop 4 - 5 times on different floors in your way up or down. I probably would not stay in this hotel again, nor would I recommend anyone else to stay in it. I'd rather pay slightly extra without feeling like I'm sitting in a none sanitary placeBut I have to mention that their real asset is their staff, they were all very friendly and attentive especially Andrews a member of their house keeping team",20-Apr-17,"Manama, Bahrain",not fake

"Michalis CLimassol, ",Very good Hotel in a great location !!,"I have been to Millennium Plaza hotel for 5 nights during April 2017 and I will share with you some pros and some cons as per my opinion:Pros:1) Very good and fast internet connection over the whole hotel. Even in the pool area. Few hotels have such a good internet connection at almost every part of the hotel. And is free of course.2) Friendly staff3) Spacious room4) Large shower with a ""raining"" system. There is a bath as well.5) Nice ""rich"" breakfast until 10:306) Big Comfortable bed.7) Nice TV in the room.8) Pool area is great, life-guarded and you can be there until 22:00. The water is warm. 9) Metro station opposite the entrance.10) fast check-in and check-out process.11) Fast food, bus station, restaurants, exchange, supermarkets, pharmacy next to the hotel.Cons:1) Elevators (long queues and ridiculous waiting time for the elevator to arrive) One morning I was waiting the elevator for TWENTY FIVE (25) minutes. NO IS NOT a joke.2) I have booked the hotel from Booking.com and the price for five nights with breakfast was 794 euros (all taxes included). However my VISA was charged 823.73 euros. I don't care for the exchange rate variance. The agreeable price was 794 euros. In addition, they still hold 163 euros on my visa as a deposit. 3) I did not like my room view. Was not facing Sheikh Zayed Road.Hope my review is helpful.",19-Apr-17,Cyprus,not fake

I was woken up in the early hours one morning by the door bell of my room, I answered thinking that something was wrong only to be greeted by room service I did not order, when I informed the staff member this was not mine I did not receive an apology and was then unable to return back to sleep. When I first got to the room I noticed a number of issues, the chain on the door was broken, there was a sewing pin stuck in the headboard of the bed right where someone would have put their head.I also returned to the room one day to find no towels had been left, I contacted reception three times and was told that housekeeping would deliver them soon however I had to wait an hour and a half to be able to shower as the towels did not turn up. The soap and shower cap boxed in the bathroom were both empty when I arrived at the hotel, the boxes looked tatty with stains on, these were not changed or filled for the whole of the stay.I was disturbed on a regular basis by the works going on at the hotel, I appreciate that upgrades need to be made however I was not informed of this work prior to checking in.However I did have a fantastic service at the hotel spa and would recommend a Swedish massage, the ladies working in the spa were very pleasant and accommodating.",,,

Hussain901,Be aware of this hotel,"Be aware of this hotel they will steal your money.I made a booking through Expedia but when I arrived to the hotel the reception told me that I do not have booking and offered me new booking which was more expensive than expida, I told him that I have booking and Expedia price is cheaper than hotel price.He said "" but we do not have booking for you so make new one and if you wish make it through Expedia ""So did and he checked me in.After I came Back home I found that I was charged for both bookings so I called Expedia. Expedia called the hotel to find out what happened.The hotel said I did not show and they charge full amount for no show.I explained to Expedia what happened and I checked in so saying I did not show is a lie.Be aware of this hotel.I am planing to report the hotel to the department of Tourism & Commerce during my visit next weekBe aware of the hotel",15-Apr-17,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia",not fake

jaimecor123,Dream trip to Dubai,"The hotel was very nice and room was very big. The staff was very nice very helpful. In the kitchen, in the lobby everywhere. We loved the stay. Specially nawal was very helpful she was ready to answer all the questions we had. We would definitely come back. The only thing I didn't like was that the housekeeping was a bit slow. Other than that we loved the stay. The concierge team was very good always there to help. We are definitely coming back to this hotel and will recommend it to other people also. Because everything is near the hotel, if you want to exchange the money it's right opposite in the metro station. The pharmacy is also very close by so it's a very good place to stay",15-Apr-17,N/A,not fake

Staff is very friendly and nice and hotel looks very impressive. Let me advice you to put more sunbeds because whenever I come i can not find place. Wi-fi conection is only 1 hour,its really not enough for visitors .Palms at swimming pool look dry and unatractive.

Alisia B,A MUCH NEEDED GETAWAY,"I stayed at this hotel this past weekend on 4/7 - 4/9, 2017. This was my first time in Dubai but I absolutely loved it and will definitely recommend this hotel. It's 5 stars, it's located in a prime location downtown, the views from my room was remarkable, the hotel staff was great, my room was super clean and the bathroom was the highlight of the entire room I couldn't stop talking about it. You will definitely fall in love with the shower. The hotel has a restaurant and the lunch buffet is definitely overwhelming and delicious. The breakfast buffet was large but had many different cuisines and I get it because it catered to every guest there so in other words something for everyone. The concierge was very helpful as well as the people who book the tours. Which I actually recommend if its your first time. If you like water you will definitely like the pool and they have a spa. I could see the Burj Khalifa from my room and many other buildings with great architecture. My room was on the 46th floor. The only thing I'd suggest is the hotel get airport shuttle. The mini bar can get pricey I had two cokes and it was like 42AED. Just read the listing before you use the bar. A great hotel.",12-Apr-17,"Salmiyah, Kuwait",not fake

Chefindro,Living in the Sky,"the hotel is located on Sheikh Zayed Road right opposite Emirates Tower metro station with many eateries, shops and malls around. Right from our arrival to this beautiful hotel, we were taken aback with the professionalism and hospitality of the staffs. The rooms are spacious with all modern amenities available at hands' reach. We were given a room on the 45th floor and the view from the glass windows were breathtaking. We could see almost whole of Dubai's shoreline from our room and that was an experience. The breakfast at the restaurant was amazing with a lot of items to choose from. there were choices for everyone, from Arabs to Asians to European.......it could have catered to all palate. They had in room dining facility and service was really efficient. Even the cleaning and laundry services was up to the mark. We like to thank Mr. Saurav Guha, the Director of Sales and his team for this amazing room and hotel. We stayed there for 8 days and never wished to leave at the end. We hope to be back there very soon and our choice for Dubai will always be Millennium Plaza",11-Apr-17,"Diani Beach, Kenya",not fake

YukiDy,Infinity Health Club snd Spa,"Very upscale vibe of the rooftop pool as it is overlooking the backside part of sheikh zayed. Very friendly staff, the pool temp can be adjusted depends on the weather. I like that they also have caf_ and restaurant and you can even have buffet in the pool area. They also have free Wifi in the entire hotel even in the pool area. The gym is not crowded so that's really A+ for me. . However, the problem is they put the AC in high temperature hence the entire room is so cold hence makes it difficult for you to do your workout.. Do you want people to get Pneumonia? One downside as well is that neither sauna or steam bath is working. That's sad. Hopefully they can do something about it. But overall it's an excellent hotel", 9 April 2017,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",not fake

josemanuel04,Good Stay at Millennium Plaza Hotel Dubai,"Big hotel, but still good customer service.Very convenient location since it is meters away from the city's metro station as well as various restaurants, cafes, stores, supermarkets. It is also near the airport and also relatively close to Dubai Mall.The gym is very complete. It has weight machines, treadmills, dumbbells, bars, and even a section were you can practice combat moves against a base punching and stretching if you are into martial arts, boxing or similar disciplines.The staff was very polite and helpful, never got a NO for an answer.Also, at the lobby, you can find a desk with someone available to help you book and find information about touristic activities such as city tours and visits to the Burj Khalifa.The swimming pool looked nice as well, and they also have a spa at the same building where the gym is located (crossing the bridge at the 5th floor), however could not say much about it because I did not experience it.The only things I did not like was the breakfast buffet prices, found that a little expensive even for Dubai. And also that sometimes there were problems with the elevators (either waiting too much or broken).In general, it was a good stay.",06-Apr-17,N/A,not fake

Dealt with Diorella at the Check-in counter and she made us waited for 45 minutes. No smile no excuse and she was super rude to us. She could not find our booking unless she checked with reservation team. While on the phone with reservation team she was discussing her personal stuff while we were waiting and looking at her if she found our booking or not? I showed her the voucher and she kept insisting that ""She know everything"". Her behavior took me by surprise as i wasn't expecting this from her. Requested for Sheikh Zayed View and she said straight NO though she had given us a room on the top floor which I've asked for. The room was OK with not much of cleanness. Breakfast was good and the staff was helping. Check out was smooth with no hassle. I'm not sure if i really wanted to come back.",æ1 April 2017,"Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",not fake

A very professional and respectful person with great communication skills who actually knows how to make you feel at home every single time. Mr. Bob Rustamov is very warm and knowledgable, a person who makes you feel the hotel as your own home and thus more attractive to come back for a second, a third time and so on, definitively he is an asset to the company. I won't hesitate to book the Millenium Plaza Hotel Dubai again.Staying at the 53rd floor for 8 nights was a great decision, the view, especially at night is awesome, fabulous!Thank you Millenium Hotel staff and thank you Bob, you are the best!Jorge Negron", 31 March 2017,"Norwalk, Connecticut",not fake

Richelle S,"Excellent Service, Great Location, Lovely Hotel","I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with 2 colleagues whilst on a business trip. The reception area looked impressive with big chandeliers and nice seating. Check in was straightforward and took about 10 minutes.My room was on the 46th Floor and had a great view over Dubai. The room was quite big, it had usual amenities such as TV, iron, hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was large and had a wet room with shower as well as a bath and complimentary toiletries.Housekeeping was good and one day they forgot to leave fresh towels, after calling to request some, they were with me within 10 minutes.Breakfast is on the 5th floor and although there is a choice of cereals, cakes, fruit, yogurts, hot food, omelettes and pancakes, I felt for a 5 star hotel there could have been more variety.Internet in the rooms was really good and fast. It is free for up to 3 devices.The location of the hotel could not have been better. Although it was opposite a metro station, taxis were so cheap we did not use the metro. A taxi from the airport cost 58 Dirhams which is about £13 for 3 people and lots of luggage. I had asked the hotel for a quote to pick us up at the airport and was quoted 180 Dirhams (£40) so it is much cheaper at the airport and there are lots of taxis waiting.A taxi to The World Trade Centre cost about £4, again this was for 3 people. The Dubai Mall is about £8 by taxi.I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Dubai and had a great time here.The rooftop pool is nice and the hotel does a BBQ by the pool 2 nights a week which is worth trying. The Jacuzzi is also nice and the water really warm.All staff at the hotel were extremely helpful, polite and pleasant. They were always smiling.",30-Mar-17,Sittingbourne,not fake

I was promised that the amount will be reversed in less than a week. It has now been 2 and a half months later and I am getting absolutely no response in regards to my case. No one responds to my emails and I have had to make numerous international calls to try and get my money back. They just tell me my case has been closed, even though I have not had any proof that they have refunded my money. My bank has confirmed that no refund has been made and I sent that through to them and I still have no recourse as to when I will be refunded!

The buffet breakfast makes it worthwhile to get up at least 45 mins earlier than normal just to enjoy breakfast. The hotel is spotless and the rooms are immaculate. The location is perfect, across from the financial centre with some of DubaiÍs best restaurants including the Italian Cipriani, or a mix of Mediterranean cuisine Boca. The views are of course spectacular.. the Emirate Towers, Burj Khalifa etc. all neighbours along the Sheikh Zayed road.

NYandAussie,Excellent airport hotel for short stopovers,"If you've done all the sights in Dubai, and just need a hotel to relax and break up long overseas flights, this is a good choice. It's very close to airport (taxi fare around US$10, or free hotel shuttle). Rooms are a tad dated, but comfortable king size beds, and large bathroom with a nice soaking bath. Also surprisingly quiet given the proximity to the airport and major highway. We had an undisturbed sleep both nights.Pool area is large, but could do with a refurbish -- lounge sets and covers need to be replaced. However, it is pleasant to relax pool side, have a swim, and order a light lunch to be enjoyed outdoors.We sampled the buffet breakfast -- full English is on the expensive side (approx US$35 each), but the continental ($25) has lovely selection of fresh fruits, yoghurts, pastries, breads, cheeses and cold meat and salads.We had dinner one night in the Mexican restaurant, and were pleasantly surprised by the good quality Mexican food and reasonable prices. We also ordered room service one evening.If you do have an urge to explore more of Dubai, or visit the malls, there is a train station only a 5minute walk from the hotel. Taxis are also a reasonably priced option.",19-Mar-17,"Maroochydore, Australia",not fake

Fadz A,I love it,"Hotel is located somehow in the middle of the city and it's accessible with the metro (train) just opposite the hotel. The room was spectacular awesome (premium room). The king bed was so comfy, clean bathroom (plus point: there's a window next to the bathtub which u can literally watch TV while u soak in), room is neat and tidy and the view is superb; from far I can see the sea (level 31). Love the gym, sauna and steam room. The gym instructor was so friendly and kind. If im not mistaken, her name is Marina. She's from Russia. For breakfast, there are different kind of cuisine served. Overall I satisfied with everything.",13-Mar-17,N/A,not fake

A TripAdvisor,"If you're a clean freak, avoid this place.","Great service, amazing food, and very spacious rooms. The biggest downgrade to the hotel is the hygiene. TERRIBLE. Blood stain on my sheets (tiny but nasty). Dusty countertops. Stained carpets & toilet seat. Bathtub wasn't cleaned. Bathrobe wasn't washed or even hung after. You can judge a book by its cover when you first enter the hotel's lobby. Dirty sofas and dirty tables with coffee stains. If you're looking for a luxury hotel, this may not be the right one for you.

All the staff were friendly and helpful. The pool is clean and has amazing views, we always got a sun bed and they provide towels at the pool. We had breakfast included, which had plenty of choice. The hotel is located in financial district, with restaurants and supermarkets in close walking distance. The metro is opposite the hotel and very cheap and easy to use to get all of the main places. We stayed on the 40th floor and found it sometimes took a while to get a lift. We both really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel.", 11 March 2017,Essex,not fake

LoriMarechal,Dated and in need of urgent refurbishment,"We have stayed recently at this hotel and were rather disappointed. The hotel is not that majestic and shiny as on their website. The whole hotel has an air of old and chipped. The walls are all dirty, reception area dusty and cluttered. The check in process took ages, service impersonal and not very welcoming. After a 6 hour flight and arrival around midnight, the receptionist took his time completing the formalities, not communicating with us in the process and seemed unsure of what he was doing. Took around 40 minutes to check in. Communication by email is also very slow, took a day on each occasion to get a response. The rooms d_cor is very basic and the rooms are poorly aerated. We have asked for a non-smoking room and the room offered stank of stale and cigarettes. Cleanliness of the room and bathroom was rather poor, strands of hair in places. Even the bottle opener in the room was sticky and had a long strand of hair. We made sure to spend the whole time out coming only to sleep. Of course we did not even attempt to eat at the hotel, if the cleanliness standards are like this in the room, imagine what is in the kitchen.The hotel is located immediately on a street, it does not have a dedicated area, Burger King next door, front full of cigarette butts and clutter. Only the doormen were very courteous and polite. They were very helpful with the luggage, directions and getting cabs for us. Check out also took long, no apologies or anything. We love Dubai and its hospitality and it is unfortunate that on this occasion, we remained less impressed with the hotel, they are usually excellent.", 2 March 2017,"London, United Kingdom",not fake

Piyush P,One of the most convenient places to stay.,"Metro station couldn't be any closer. Lots of restaurants on both sides of hotel. Plenty of taxies were available. Most of our trips in taxi were around 20 dirham. Convenient store, Pharmacy & money exchange shop next door. We had a large group of 22 people on vacation. The front desk staff & concierge staff was very friendly & helpful meeting most of our needs. Even with large group check in & check out were a breeze. Manager Mohammed was great when we needed some rooms past our check out time due to flight schedule.Couple of things that some of us experienced that could have been better were, depending who was making the beds and rooms there was no consistency in the number & types of towels, number of water bottles, bathroom rug, & other supplies. But only a phone call away. Some rooms didn't have the European to US converters or the USB outlets. The concierge desk was helpful in getting them but there was a limited supplies so had to wait a day or two. Don't take things out of the expensive cash bar refrigerator. (Convenient store next door) Great rainfall shower heads. Although I wish it had regular shower too or have a fixture to put the handheld hose higher, and a place to seat in the shower. Our package included breakfast. It was well worth the money. Even for vegetarians. Attendant Mohan was really good at reserving tables as soon as he saw you and replacing cups and plates when u went to get more food. Naveed made awesome custom omelet even with lots of people inline. Food choices were plenty. Really good fresh juice & fruits. Great rooftop pool on second building. The AC worked perfectly. Nice wall to ceiling windows. All rooms were decent size. Bonus: decent WIFI signal even in our rooms as high as 59th floor. Highly recommend for all on budget.",27-Feb-17,N/A,not fake

The reception got the bill wrong twice and failed to charge for the taxi to the airport so we paid the taxi driver and saved 60 diram which would have been the hotel charge . The only good things about this hotel is it has a fabulous rooftop swimmimg pool in the building next door and is connected by a bridge but no changing rooms. The staff in the restaurant were very good and polite but as previously said in comparision to other hotels in Dubai the food was very poor the only really saving grace was the location right on the metro 10 yards from the door and your in the station personally I would not stay here again",24-Feb-17,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",not fake

But they did not pay our cash payment, it was paid as ADN when we were checked out. These all experience are so bad, but last day, I have left my vallet in my room, and went to breakfast, when I back to my room, 100 USD was missed with 20 TRY, I asked security manager, they said that we have investigation procedure, we would follow it, but they could not find anything, and they said that we will not show our camera records because of laws. So my money is lost without any records, I have to accept this with only explanation but without any proof.

Grabitaly,pro & cons,"Ok, it's handy if you're in Duabi for job and want to move with the subway. The upper floors have a good view. Breakfast is well served, but there is a very small lobby (work in progress), even if the staff is attentive. 3 lifts for more than 60 flors are not enough.I truly detestable found that the bathroom was not really cleaned up, but only cleared up: I found the same hair or bits of paper in the same places during 4 days. I do not think it is a great quality hotel. I will not return there.",,,

Good value for a reasonable cost. Very efficient work of phone operators! Leaving hotel, I realized that I had left my laptop charger behind. Many thanks to Moamen, who dealt with my request in no time and were able to send me back the forgotten item on the same evening. It is a good city hotel, suitable for business travel. Millenium Plaza is surrounded by many cafeterias from, so you won't run out of choice of where to eat out.

JKBHerts,Good location. Dry Hotel,"We stayed with colleagues for business for 5 nights. Excellently situated right by the train station only 1 stop to the World Trade Centre. Had a room on the 54th floor with an amazing view. Small with very little storage but adequate. Pool area nice with a helpful chap serving the food and nice juices. Everything is expensive in Dubai so be prepared. Plenty of choice at breakfast. Need to give yourself time to get down in the lifts at busy times of day. Had to pay for internet connection 20 dirham per day in the room and also there was a 20dir charge per day per room tourist tax which is normal I believe. We had not read in any reviews that they didn't serve alcohol at all in The Millenium so we had to walk to the Four Points Sheraton roof top bar which was a 10 min walk away. Paid £75, yes ££, for an ordinary Pinot Grigio there but got a good view. If you go before 8pm they have a 'happy hour'. The information folder in the room says there is a free shuttle bus to the beach but they don't offer that service. The reception asked us to bring down the folder but we took a photo instead to prove it. Still didn't provide it!!!Also only 2 stops to The Dubai Mall. Excellent location, but we do like a glass of wine with our meal so would not return purely on that basis.", 29 January 2017,Hertfordshire,not fake

Chandra Mohan J,A delightful holiday,"We were here from 21 Jan to 25 Jan on a short holiday.The location is a major plus. There is a Metro Station just outside the entrance and with the Dubai Mall and the Burj Khalifa just two stops away the ease of travel and connectivity make this a major plus point The rooms are nice and comfortable . All facilities are included. There is a tea and coffee maker provided.The breakfast is good with a good spread. The only somewhat negative bit is the WIFI. Free WIFI is available only for an hour and that too only in the lobby. The hotel chooses to charge you additionally for this facility in your room which by today's standards elsewhere is a distinct negative observation.However the courteous staff who go out of their way to be helpful are a major plus that is commendable. We found immense positivity and courtesy in the staff that we dealt with. I would like to commend Nawal, Bishnu, Dinesh and Samy for their courtesy and care during our stay. We would definitely stay here again in the future too. The staff deserve a special commendation as this is a major consideration.",26-Jan-17,"Noida, India",not fake

Not dramatic but could have gained an extra hour3. I witnessed issues at the front desk with two (outspoken) disgruntled guests4. Rooms are big5. Lifts are a problem especially that although they are four some show the full sign with only 4 guests so prepare to wait 10-15 minutes especially at breakfast time6.

MrAMalik,POO IN OUR ROOM & RUINED OUR NEW YEAR'S,,,,
,,"Travelled to Dubai with my wife and 2 friends to celebrate our first anniversary, my birthday and the New Year. Millennium Plaza Hotel was the worst decision weÍve ever made.Our bidet shower had POO on it. The sockets were falling apart. The door handle was broken. The iron in the room was faulty. The safe was faulty. The wardrobe rail was falling apart. The sink taps were loose. And the list goes on. After an unnecessarily lengthy conversation and meeting with the hotel manager, we were merely offered free breakfast. Having insisted on having our room changed, and with an entire day wasted we were finally relocated.Then, of course, a new issue with the hotel. The card with which we had booked the hotel online was void as the bank had issued a new, replacement card for the same account. The full amount for the duration of our stay had already left our bank account and we had proof of payment. This was unacceptable to the hotel, and they insisted we produced the void card _ they refused to accept the new card. It became a daily occurrence for us to spend around 2 hours a day being harassed by hotel management and chasing up our bank. The hotel suddenly terminated our stay on New YearÍs Eve! With nowhere to go, and our luggage locked in our room, we spent a hellish New YearÍs Eve. Eventually, our bank helped us out and the hotel staff accepted our bank card and let us access our room and luggage.There were other issues throughout our stay, but the aforementioned are the key points.Whatever you do, please LOOK ELSEWHERE. Do not book Millennium Plaza Hotel at any cost!",19-Jan-17,"Oslo, Norway",not fake

The only confusion is how to come back from there while going you have to go to 5th floor while coming back press metro restaurant. Otherwise you will be lost. What I don't like is they charge you of Internet 20 Aed per day for 2 phones. Internet is free only if you directly book from the hotel.Lobby has free WiFi but u will not be able to voice call or video call.I mean these days lot of people are booking by Booking .com and have never seen this.And if 2 families are going togather you might not get rooms on the same floor plus you will also not get king size bed.Twin beds which they will join for u if u want though I will not advice for .And they have dim lights in room.

TPK751,"WiFi is 20 AED per day, for 2 devices only. Really ? In 2016 ?","I have not yet finished writing down the report for this hotel, but, I have to share immediately one experience that pisses me off : WiFi. 1/ Contrary to what some booking websites may say, WiFi is chargeable at 20AED (2.70USD) per day. US citizens won't be surprised, but, in this advanced part of the world where even WiFi on airline is free, it is something not acceptable. 2/ It is valid up to two devices concurrently. What ??? Do you live in 2016 ? It's not uncommon to have 2 devices per person (a phone and a tablet), if not many more. Of course, we, humans, have only two hands and we rarely use two devices simultaneously, but, let's face reality : most of us leave all our devices wired on 24/7. It's quite unhuman to ask us to login when we use, and logout when we don't use. 3/ Let's talk about logout. While facing the ""2 devices max"" issue, I tried to log out, but couldn't find out how (shutting off the WiFi, or powering off the device didn't do the trick). Not being a geek, but just an average Joe, I looked in the hotel booklet and in the room, but, there was no information whatsoever concerning WiFi, so, I called ""extension 0"" as it is indicated on the blocked screen of the phone, which transfers me to the reception (?!?). The receptionist seems to be aware of this kind of situation and tells me what to type in the address bar of the browser. This doesn't work, so I call him back. Same answer, but tells me that IT will come back to me at 9 am. As I couldn't wait, I tried different combination, and found out by myself the correct wording [sorry guys, TA keeps censuring the address considering it as a commercial advertising].Does it spoil my stay ?

JoannaJeremia,Room with Dubai View!,"We recently stayed here for a staycation. Our room was changed by the staff to the one facing the Burj Khalifa as per our request. Given that we requested on the same day and the hotel was of almost full occupancy. Most are Asian travelers. Our room is located at the 57th floor and we love our window view! It was very memorable for us as it was our first time to see our second home from that point.The bed was comfortable but the hotel is missing neck pillows so I have less sleep here. Plus the housekeeping actually takes time to response. But nevertheless, we enjoyed our short stay here because of the room view, staff service from the restaurant, the reception was fine but not as warm compared to other hotels we stayed in Dubai plus the bathtub was so huge and my husband super enjoyed it! :) Breakfast was fine but the air conditioning in the restaurant was low and it was the same design since our last visit. I guess the hotel need to improve the restaurant design. Location is perfect! It's literally a few steps away from Dubai Metro Emirates Towers station.Overall, we had a pleasant stay in this hotel and we'd be happy to return some other time.", 12 December 2016,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",not fake

Coneisha B,Great location.,"The hotel is located in a very good area. The metro station is literally in front of the hotel which equals easy access to all areas in the city. The room was okay. The view was okay as well. We had a room that overlooked the Arabian Gulf which was much better at night due to all the city lights. The washroom was the best in my opinion. The room was clean and comfortable. I dont understand how a 5* hotel requires guest to pay for wifi. I really didn't like that. 20 dirhams per day.. cheap but still unreasonable for a five star.. In my opinion. Didn't try breakfast after reading previous reviews on the food. The staff was pretty friendly but the guy who checked us in was very laconic and not really welcoming however, check in and check out was very fast and easy. The television in our room wasn't working.. we called down and they sent someone up in a timely fashion. I probably wouldn't stay again at this hotel. For 5* I found it to be lacking. I've stayed in Dubai numerous of times and this being the second 5* hotel I booked .. I thought the 4* hotels I had in the past exceeded my expectations far more. However clean hotel, located perfectly in Dubai.",10-Dec-16,N/A,not fake

hhakim,"Modern, Comfortable & Pleasant","The hotel is located on the Sheikh Zayed Road, which is one of the main roads in Dubai. There's a Dubai Metro station (Emirates Towers station - Red Line) right in front of the hotel, which is a huge convenience. It's only 2 stops towards the UAE Exchange station if you want to go to the Dubai Mall / Burj Khalifa. Pretty much, staying at this hotel gives you the flexibility to take either the metro or taxi to get to your destinations. Fyi - there's a taxi stop at the trunk road right in front of the hotel as well.There's nothing to shout about on the hotel lobby. It's very basic as the space is limited. The room is very modern, clean, well maintained with new furniture & comfy bed. The bed/pillows are comfortable. The bathroom is big with separate shower & toilet with a good size bath tub. If you stay here, please request for the city view. The sea view was not good at all.We didn't have breakfast or the main meals in the hotel - so, no comments on the food or restaurants. The hotel staff is very helpful. The front desk personnel Mr. Herman Santoso deserves a praise for being very attentive & helpful.I believe this hotel is well worth it for the price that we pay considering the location in the city with multiple transportation options right in front of the hotel, the quality of service & the quality of the room.", 22 -Nov-2016,Malaysia,not fake

Loksanchari,Continues to be excellent,"Firstly I would like to thank Daniel Mathew for making my holiday very pleasant . The room was fantastic, clean and we had an excellent view of Sheikh Zayed Road and the Burj. The food at the restaurant during breakfast continues to be maintained at good standards with very good attention given to guests by the staff there.Like I have mentioned in my previous review this continues to be an excellent hotel with easy access to the Metro (opposite the hotel to be precise).There was a bit of confusion about charging two different cards after a couple days of leaving Dubai - one the deposit was held for and the other card with which I actually paid the bill. However the problem was easily resolved over email.I expected that confusion to arise because the chap at the reception looked like a trainee and new and another receptionist had to help him. These are minor problems which can happen with any trainee staff I guess.I would like to mention Lalit and Keshav again. They continue to be as courteous and respectful as before. Excellent pleasing manners.Special thanks to the staff at the Reception. They were polite and patient . They had my room ready despite me arriving in the early hours of the morning.The gym has been upgraded but the dumbells which are heavy would not fit on the stand and a 36kg dumbbell nearly fell on my foot. This probably will need attended to. The trainer in the gym was very polite, apologetic and understood the problem when I explained to her.The pool continues to be clean and well attended to.The room was regularly cleaned and it was very comfortable with a super sized comfy bed. I am looking forward for my next visit to The Millennium Plaza and hope they continue to maintain the standards and hospitality they have showered on me over the past 3 years.",13-Nov-16,N/A,not fake

They did all the effort to make the payment happen (since I was under a very strict time table due to my flight that was going to departure). However this was an unpleasant thing, they did really everything to help me. They even offered my transport to the airport at no extra cost.",10-Nov-16,N/A,not fake

Ziba Z,Not a 5 start hotel at all,"I stayed there this October for one week during Gitex exhibition. We were 35 people. Some of us were colleagues and some were our guests. In my point of view, it wasn't a good hotel at all. Not at all a 5 star hotel.The breakfast was ok, specially the omlettes were really delicious. But I believe for a 5 star hotel there should be more variety of cheeses on the table.Checking in and out took quite a long time and in the check out they had charged us for internet but we had payed for the internet before. It was in our package.The last day we gave the luggages to the luggage room. Two of the suitcases were returned with broken handles. We had to go to the airport and the manager was telling me to wait till they check with the staff and then check the cameras and that would take about 3 days.They didn't put enough Shampoos, etc in the rooms, and with each day passing the number of the towels were reducing so that each day I had to call the reception and ask them to send towels for the rooms.Two of the rooms' showers didn't have warm water and it took about 24 hours for the staff to fix it.In one other room, we didn't have access to the internet and it took them more than 48 hours to fix it. They even changed the modem twice.But the lobby was very beautiful and the staff were nice when we asked them for something though they wouldn't do it.Overall we didn't have a good stay and the whole time I was trying to make them give a better service to our guests.The very last day I explained all of these to the manager of the hotel and he just told me he was sorry that I wasn't satisfied but everyone else is actually satisfied. Not quite what I was waiting for.The location of the hotel is great, because there's a metro station just outside the door, and for us that were going to the exhibition all the time it is really near to the world trade center. Just one metro stop away.", 7 -Nov- 16,N/A,not fake

The room was a premium luxury room and was great; we had a sea view, comfortable King size bed, rainfall shower and a huge bathtub. We had complimentary water bottles and coffee/tea, which we used everyday. The hotel is situated opposite the Emirate Towers metro station which was very handy as we were able to easily get to the Dubai Mall within minutes. It was approximately a 10 minute drive from Dubai airport.The service was great and we were always asked by all the staff if we needed anything. The location was awesome; there were lots of restaurants right next door including Costa coffee, Caffe Nero, Burger King, Chili's, Starbucks, and Tim Hortons. Most of these places were 24 hours, including a pharmacy right next door. It was a very lively area; we went out at midnight for a walk and the place was alive! We went for shisha and watched a football match in the middle of a plaza.The hotel is a great place is you are interested in convenience of location and you don't have to worry about food either.

And while furniture in some rooms apprars quite worn-out, the rates are competitive even with 4* hotels on Sheikh Zayed road. So overall this hotel is an good value. And exceptionally friendly service adds value as well.The weakest point of the hotel is probably breakfast. While service is great and quantity is generous, quality lacks noticeably. Meat cuts and sausages are so low quality, they'd rather not be there at all. Also, something worth to note is that hotel is 100% alcohol free, whether it's good ir not - one has to decide for himself.Finally, to be totally fair, the hotel's nice spa, infinity pool and large fitness center must be noted. And unlike other hotels, fitness is actually stuffed with professional trainers who are very helpful and resourceful.", 6 October 2016,N/A,not fake

Mika, Ian and Christine make you the best start into the morning you can ever have. Only one moment with them and they make you feel great. THIS is what makes a 5 star hotel. The people, the feeling you have during a stay. If they would change to work in another hotel, honestly I tell you, I would change the hotel as well. The boss can be very happy and proud to have these 3 people in his team. That it is what it is about: They shine, they make you smile, they make you feel really good and valued. To experience in a big hotel that type of family feeling, this is really unique. From my side this team deserves more than ""five stars"". I am very sure that Mika will have a very successful professional future. As well as Ian and Christine. I really hope that the General Manager will honor this unique combination of professionalism and humanity. Thank you very much!

shghanian,The worst hotel I have ever stayed at!,"This was our fourth time travelling to Dubai. We had the experience of staying at 5 star hotels like Crowne Plaza, Radisson blu and Media Rotana. All of them where more or less good, clean, nice hotels and we were always satisfied with their services. This time we chose Millennium Plaza because it is located in the sheikh Zayed Road and is close to the metro station. But as soon as we got there, everything was quite frustrating. The hotelÍs lobby is a very small place with old dirty furniture that not at all seems suitable for a five star hotel! They advertise that free Wi-Fi is available at the hotelÍs lobby, but the truth is that you just can use internet for one hour every 24 hours! The Tour Agency had booked for us an standard room for 3 people (as we always do and hotels usually give an extra bed for the third person) and the booking had been confirmed by the hotel. but when we got their , The reception clerk- a woman with a big frown on her face- said that it was impossible for us to stay at that room because it doesnÍt have enough space for 3 people at all! And we had to pay extra money (about 200 dhs) to get a larger room. It was really annoying! The hotelÍs services were not any better than other things! We had paid for 3 people but every day we should remind them that we need shampoo or drinking water for 3. And to make our staying even worst, checking out of the hotel, they charged us for 2 bottle of water in the fridge about 30 dhs! 5 times of its real price perhaps! And when we complained, they didnÍt answer really politely. Millennium Plaza is not a hotel that I can suggest anyone. They donÍt care about their guests.", 28 September 2016,"Tehran, Iran",not fake

cornishboy21,Excellent hotel in an excellent location,"This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in.It is clean and very well presented and the rooms were immaculately clean and very spacious too. The staff could not do enough to help us and were very friendly and attentive.The location is ideal for both business people and tourists. For the former, it is within Dubai's downtown area and for the latter, it is centrally located. The souks are a quick metro ride in one direction, the mall, fountains and Burj Khalifa are only two stops away in the other direction and the marina is easy to get to by metro too. The hotel is directly opposite the entrance to the Emirates Towers metro station. Accessing the metro from this hotel could not be easier.The only meals I ate in the restaurant was breakfast and that matched the hotel's good quality. There was lots of choice, the restaurant was clean and the food was of a good quality.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dubai and when I return to the city, this will be my first choice.",22-Sep-16,England,not fake

Grace and Wayne M,A pleasant stay in Duabai,"I chose this hotel mostly because of the location. The entrance to the Emirates Towers metro station is literally at the door. A taxi rank is also handy, to avoid the heat. Burj Khalifa/ Dubai Mall is 2 metro stops away.and you can also take the metro direct to the DXB airport terminals 1 & 3 without changing trains for only 5AED. We were offered a room upgrade on check-in. There were some operational problems with regard to our room servicing, however staff were quick to rectify matters and on check-out Svetlana was apologetic and the manager kindly compensated us for the inconvenience.The view from the hotel pool is not to be missed. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are luxuriant. The breakfast buffet is adequate, but the pancakes and hash browns are not very good. There are enough other options catering to the hotel's international clientele.Tip: the dining area is spacious, but get to breakfast early to avoid the queue. The hotel staff are well trained, impeccably dressed, helpful and very friendly. They can take pride collectively in their contribution to guests' enjoyment.

ConEfChriMa,"Nice hotel, good location","We are a family of four and we have stayed there during our summer holidays. We have booked two rooms for our short stay, a superior double bed and a superior with two single beds for our kids. When booking, we have requested two interconnected rooms, or two rooms as close as possible to each other and this has been settled. Check in is quick, staff is very polite and professional. The hotel is situated on Sheikh Zayed Road running through the city of Dubai. We always stay at hotels on the beach when we visit Dubai, mostly at the Palm or at Jumeirah area, where the view is usually fantastic. It is our sixth vacations at Dubai, but the first time we stayed at a hotel downtown so the view of the city was a nice change for us. This is not a beach hotel, but it has a very small pool which despite the hotelÍs number of rooms has some available beds. It is on the 12th floor at the back of the hotel, so the view is not downtown Dubai, but you can see the older parts of the city with low buildings. Pool water temperature is ok. Rooms are very clean. Some mould in the shower thwarts the room of an immaculate condition. Sleeping quality is very good, beds are very comfortable, climate control is very good, but two things have to be mentioned. Sound insulation is very poor. You can hear guests walking the alleys and room doors slam very loud if left open. If you are in the bathroom you can clearly hear what people say when they are at their bathroom. You get free water in the rooms. Breakfast buffet is the poorest we have seen so far at a Dubai hotel in terms of variety, but remains at an acceptable level. Some benches behind the staff preparing the breakfast could look tidier and cleaner. A small detail, staff should not interrupt a conversation between a guest and another member of the staff. Wi fi is not free, you can find further info through your booking site. As in many hotels, donÍt use any private car or taxi offered by the hotelÍs concierge, unless you are willing to pay 50 or in some cases 100% more than the usual taxi fare. Standard taxis that have the RTA sign charge normal taxi fare. If you are a family of more than five, look for an SUV. It has 7 seats and the fare is the same with the smaller sedans. It costs less than AED 15 (4 euros) including tips to Dubai Mall by taxi and approximately AED 50 (12 euros) to Dubai (DXB) airport. Check out is quick and charges are exactly as booked. Overall, this is a nice hotel but not the one I would spend my two week vacations with my kids, not because of any lack of amenities but because of lack of activities which could keep the kids busy, such as big pools. I would suggest it for spending some days with your family if you want to combine it with some business you may have in the area.",27-Aug-16,"Nicosia, Cyprus",not fake

RamblingGlutton,OK for the location,"I stayed at this hotel during Ramadan so this obviously affected the price and available services (namely the buffet breakfast) so bear with me...All in all, it's a nice hotel that is ideally located for business travel when working in the DIFC area. You can easily walk to the DIFC (even under the scorching sun as the metro walkway is air conditionned) and, obviosuly, the metro station is a few meters from the main hotel entrance. As it's often the case with Dubai's high-rise hotels, waiting for lifts can become tedious at times. I wish high-speed lifts would become the standard...As this was Ramadan, the rates were really low and I had a huge room with a sea view for a very good price. The room itself was spotless and very cosy. I had to work a lot on my laptop whilst sitting at the desk in the room and I appreciated the overall comfort and space (feeling cramped in a hotel room is not conducive to creativity and concentration...).The checkin/checkout processes were a breeze, even in the wee hours of the morning when I had to catch an early flight. Unfortunately, the pool was closed for maintenance so I can't comment on its size/cleanliness. However, the buffet breakfast was OK even though it was Ramadan and hence a bit more limited than during the rest of the year. It was possible to eat a good breakfast as a non-muslim (and I obviously can't comment on the suhoor as I went for the 'usual' breakfast times)",23-Aug-16,"Paris, France",not fake

Fairlady M,Good Location and Comfortable Hotel,"I highly recommend Millenium Plaza Hotel especially for those their traveling in Dubai for the first time, like me. I spend 4 nights in the hotel. LOCATION for me is very important, I'm a type of person who is really poor on reading maps and very poor on direction. From the airport arrival, look for or ask the way to Metro Train station. Purchase a regular card, card cost 4-5 AED and top up starts at 25AED. Train platform is UAE Exchange from the airport to the hotel is Emirates Tower Station. The Hotel is entrance is when you step out of the Metro. The Staffs are very hospitable and warm to their guest. Wifi and Breakfast are not included in my booking, so I avail their wifi for 20AED per day 24hrs. Wifi connection is good and fast. Bfast cost 160AED per person/day, they offer me a 50% discount and I avail it for two days. Their bfast is really good and a lot of choices. The room is well maintained, clean and comfortable. I request for the high floor and non-smoking room. Every time I went outside, I will just hang a message outside to make up my room. They have gym and sauna the dry and wet, which I always use during the morning to start my day. There are fast foods, restaurants, supermarkets, clinic and pharmacy outside the hotel. Dubai highlights like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates etc. are all accessible by Metro.My overall experience in this Hotel is excellent. Definitely, I will book again in this hotel on my next visit in Dubai.",21-Aug-16,"Doha, Qatar",not fake

southernberry,Our 21 hour layover,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at Millennium Plaza Hotel for a 21 hour layover from JFK to JNB before our wedding day. Upon arrival we were greated by attentive staff at the door who quickly helped get our luggage out of the cab, waited for us to check-in and carried the bags to our room.It was easy for our driver to find the location, in fact these drivers know these hotels off by heart. Hotel within easy access to train station. Our deal for what I would consider a 5 Star room was a mere equivalent of US $70 after upgrading on arrival. We enjoyed the property and found d it to be extremely clean, top notch and modern. Breakfast selection matched the standard, we woke up late and worried because of the holy month of Ramadan, rushing to the dinning room still to find fresh delicious arrays of goodies. My husband loves his food and this, he wasn't going to miss only to be extremely impressed and wanting of more.Hotel concierge organized pick up to airport for us in the latest Lexus sedan, a treat we didn't expect. Overall we were treated with such class and dignity, there's no doubt that we've found a home in Dubai at Millennium Plaza Hotel.",11-Aug-16,Pennsylvania,not fake

Breakfast was perfect.Pool is located in 12 floor of anoter building that connected with a bridge to main building.Pool closed at 10 pm. I think its should be open till 12 because of the wether of dubai , night was the best time for using the pool. Bad thing about this hotel was the elevator because we lost a lot of time for elevator and the resturant was very small, we shoud wait and stand to find an empty table. No free Wifi in the rooms and Wifi of the lobby was slow when many users log in.Housekeeping was poor.Anyway I enjoyed the hotel.", 3 August 2016,"Shiraz, Iran",not fake

Sakhar A,Lovely Family Stay And Friendly Staff,"We are a family of four people and our stay was for five nights. The rooms were spacious and pretty and the experience was worthwhile. Few things were disappointing like servicing in the restaurant and problems with housekeeping.The rooms were pretty and spacious and they looked similar to the photos on their website. The linen covers of the bed were very comfy and they certainly made sleeping more comfortable. The lighting is controlled from a touch panels just besides the bed. (Suggestion: iPad controlling upgrade?). Sometimes the towels provided had a strange scent, probably the detergent but I wish they would make sure the towels are washed properly and do not contain any of that smell. (NB: There was a Pokstop in the hotel that was in the range of our room so we would just sit there and lure pokmons whenever we're waiting).My favorite thing to do each morning is to have a swim in the infinity pool in the morning (8 to 9 o'clock) when its empty then follow it up with breakfast.Breakfast is a buffet served from 6 to 10:30 am, the buffet has plenty of options that suits people from most nationalities. I would have liked to have more pastries because the only thing I liked in the bread section was croissants (there's sliced bread, rosemary and cupcakes). I would have liked to see Pain au chocolat or cinnamon swirls. Thats a good excuse to have breakfast elsewhere outside which is what a did on some days. There seemed to be a notable shortage of staff in the breakfast hours. 5 to 6 employees attending for roughly 70 individuals. After a table is cleared and people have sat down the cutlery sets, napkins and mugs will not be placed although they are there on the waiter's table or in the drawers so many times people will resort to self service due to lack of staff.***Staying at five star hotels resembles pretty rooms and comfort wherever possible, however, the people you deal with have a crucial effect on personal comfort, this was made clear here in Millennium during my stay that friendliness of staff does make a difference. I gathered a few examples of notable members that made our stay enjoyable. This does not restrict our experience with these employees only nor am I condemning other employees, these are just the ones I recall.As we arrived we were met by the receptionist Zoey, who offered us a free upgrade to a premium room with a lovely view of the city and Burj Khalifa (picture below). Furthermore, she answered every question we had and gave advice on services within the hotel and nearby sites. She also recommended that we book through their website instead of booking.com to receive good offers and better saving deals.Riyaz accompanied us to our rooms and showed us every feature there, his 12 years of service in the country demonstrated prominent abilities especially in understanding customers' needs.Christine was a notable member of staff in the restaurant, during peak breakfast hours she, and fellow members handled the numerous amount of people to the best of their abilities and providing the needs for them inspite of the shortage of staff and always starting with a friendly smile.Bishnu made sure our luggage were delivered on the day of arrival and checkout to and from the car. Plus, the friendly sense of humor made me look for him every time I'm in the lobby.Almost every member of my family had a positive remark on the coffee in the cafe on the ground floor, I recommend the Macchiato Latte. However, there is a shortage of variety of food options in the cafe such as the sandwiches, cakes and pastries. A bottle of water costs about 8 AED in the cafe, which is expected, but if you walk outside nearby a 2 minute walk there's a small grocery store where the water costs 1 AED.Unfortionetly, wifi in the rooms is not free it costs 10 AED per day per room and it is rather slow. I hope they improve this one important aspect.Overall, I am satisfied with my stay in this hotel, the friendliness of staff had a big impact on my satisfaction and would recommend this place for a family trip. It is worth noting that the hotel's location is very convenient as it is close from downtown Dubai and the Dubai Mall is 2 stops away by metro. (The metro is right outside the front door).", 30 July 2016 ,N/A,not fake

Housekeeping is the worst I have ever seen. Every day have to call them more than two times so they finally can clean my room. No free WIFI !!!!! Elevators are always full.

The rooms are large and nicely designed with a very comfortable bed and great bathroom. The gym is very well-equipped and has a good selection of cardio machines as well as several other machines. The pool area is also nicely designed. Since we stayed here during the very hot summer period (close to 50 degrees) we appreciated the effective and extremely quiet ventilation (ac) system in the room. On the negative side, I would mention the over expensive, and quit low-quality food in the restaurant. This also holds for the breakfast buffet.In short, I would consider staying here again!", 21 July 2016,"Bangkok, Thailand",not fake

Yuccaflower30,I am ASIAN and they judged me as PROSTITUTE...MY WORST NIGHTMARE!!!,"Eid time again in UAE and time to get away from the monotonous activities in Abu Dhabi. My destination...Dubai!Every time I wanted to visit Dubai, there is no other place in my mind (and my partner) other than Millennium Plaza Hotel considering we have been to numerous hotels/hotel apartments in Dubai. For the love of this hotel, I think we have checked in here almost 7 times in a span of 2 years. Everything is PERFECT! from the valet parking...to swift check in...to the assisting personnel and way up to the welcoming room, by the way the sumptuous buffet breakfast which is included when you check in.My very humiliating experience came on the night of 7th July 2016 a day before my birthday. Since we checked in early I think around 3:00 pm, we decided to take a rest and planned to go out in the evening so we can roam Dubai with full energy. I was so ecstatic that night, I wore my spaghetti strap orange long dress with slit above my knee on the side, it was a very decent dress which my partner bought for me. I also have my pashmina for cover up as my partner is in a way conservative. I let my long hair down for a dramatic and sophisticated look. Had a very light shade of makeup and off we go.When we came back to the hotel, I entered first in the lobby at the backside as my loving partner forgot his key inside the car. I seated on one of the chairs there and watched all visitors mostly arabic come in and out and also observing the clothes people wear...kind of my interest whenever I am in the hotel, that time I did not see any unusual behavior until I noticed one person quietly observing me, since I saw my partner coming in, I did not pay attention to this guy. People are waiting for the elevator that time and a group of people was ahead of us when suddenly this guy stopped us just at the time we are going to enter the elevator, this guy by the name of Syed (as per his name plate on his hotel uniform) asked me if I was with the guy in front of me (which is my partner) and I replied YES and then I asked him WHAT IS WRONG? and he replied if I have a UAE Identity Card and if I showed it while checking in...then my partner stepped out of the elevator and talked to the guy in arabic away from the questioning eyes of the people inside the elevator. This guy should have excused us in a polite manner and talked to us in a small corner but that did not happen. Since I am having a notion that he is speculating that my partner just picked up a lady outside, I immediately asked my partner if he showed my identity card in the reception in which he replied OF COURSE, it is a protocol in Dubai hotels. Then they continued talking and when they finished, this guy did not even bother to say I AM SORRY, just he looked at me and left.Disturbed with what happened, upon reaching our room, I asked my partner what happened and he shyly told me that this Mr. Syed thought that I am a prostitute and I was picked up from somewhere in Dubai. To be honest my partner is of different nationality and I do not know what came to the mind of this person branding my partner as someone who will pick up a hooker outside. Enraged with what I learned, I told my partner if I can double check in the reception if he really showed my Identification Card, I even borrowed his credit card to show just in case. If i were to describe my feelings that time, I would tell that my blood pressure shoot up to 200 I guess but I remained calm and fixed my composure. I reached out with the Concierge and that time there was a very accommodating person by the name of Mr. Stephen. He patiently listened to me and was very apologetic. He could not believe what his comrade did. He assured me that he will raise it to his Manager but I insisted on waiting for him so I blurt out the unexpected humiliating experience I had with one of his subordinates. Then came Mr. Manager Muhammed, talked to me and said he will do the necessary action blah blah blah and thats it, I did not feel the concern at all to be honest, as if you talked to the Lost and Found section. In the room I was waiting that the Manager will send the guy to ask for an apology, I waited until 3 am but nobody came. Maybe if Mr. Stephen of the Concierge is the Manager, maybe it will be a different story. Mr. Muhammed the Manager should learn from Mr. Stephen of Concierge the proper way to handle such customer complaints.In short...we left Millennium Hotel demoralized, hurt and aggrieved. The hotel I once adored so much is now the hotel I liked the least and the hotel that let me experienced so much humiliation in my 13 years in UAE.", 9 July 2016,Abu Dhabi,not fake

The breakfast was perfect and you do not need food till night But you should pay extra for wifi .the free wifi was reachable only in lobby and i think that does not sound good for this kind of hotel.", 9 July 2016 ,N/A,not fake

Ahmad H,Amazing hotel stay,I had really enjoyed the stay in this hotel with my family. The location is strategic in the main road of Dubai. The breakfast and the pool were also good. The most thing i liked is the service provided especially from the assistant front office manager Mr. Arun who helped me twice and provided the service perfectly with no issues.,08-Jul-16,N/A,not fake

Dylan J,Perfect Getaway - Excellent Hotel,"Our stay at Millennium Plaza Dubai was a lovely week away & exactly what we were after. Even though temperatures this time of year were reaching 41c most days - the hotels swimming pool was stunning and somewhere we could go to sun bathe, relax and every 15 minutes jump in the infinity pool to cool off. The pool was very quiet most of the time, which was nice.Taking into account it was Ramadan when we arrived, it was a little difficult getting food on occasions during day light hours, but most fast food places were open - so long as you took it away to it. So, not so good for the waist line - but hey, we were on holiday so didn't care. Ramadan finished two days before we left, so the pool bar was open for food & drink, music was playing and the hotel came alive.This hotel has a wide mix of nationalities staying at all times, which is interesting as you meet so many different people from all faiths, religions & countries.The hotel itself is stunning, the staff cannot do enough for you & the rooms are spacious, has a massive bathroom with air conditioning throughout, so did have to go outside on occasions just to warm up, can you believe. The beds are large with all you need in your room for a nice relaxing stay. The breakfast is amazing with both contemporary & continental food to meet all the needs of guests, no matter what you want. If you fancy noodles, pasta - beans, eggs, pancakes, croissants, toast, yogurts, juice, fruit, salad - it's literally all there, just dig in. We added breakfast on when we arrived, which was a little dear - but for the convenience it was ideal. The service delivered by the hotel staff was superb, the little things really do count & the hotel really delivered in its service delivery and striving for excellent service consistently. So well done, wish it was this consistent back home in the UK! The location of the hotel is fantastic! Okay, we are a little while away from the beach, but if you did want to bake in the scorching heat on a public beach; it was only a taxi ride away. The metro is literally 6 steps from the entrance of the hotel, so you don't even get warm in the heat as the hotel has air conditioning and the metro station do too. The metro is ideal with the price of an all day ticket for two people at 44D - which converts to about £8 sterling. We literally used the metro every day to go to the Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates which is amazing & HUGE - so comfy shoes are required & many other places. There are supermarkets & pharmacies close to the hotel - so very easy to get that extra sun cream if required or if you craving some diary milk chocolate - the supermarkets have an amazing choice & in the mall even had a chocolate factory bit.. Sorry - going off kilter, told you holidays are no good for the waist line! We also used the Spa facilities at the hotel, where we had a voucher for 'buy one get one free' on treatments - so we had to oblige and use it. We chose the all over body massage, wow! What an experience that was, I have never felt so relaxed & new coming out.. Sitting on a plane for 7 hours, I must say that did wonders. Do use the voucher given - I promise you won't regret it.Final thoughts - the hotel is stunning, swimming pool facilities are amazing, location is ideal, service is excellent, relaxation is key & you'll be safe in the knowledge knowing you are in a safe environment both in and outside the hotel..So seriously, book today for an amazing hospitality experience in the amazing city of Dubai.I certainly will be!!",07-Jul-16,"Bridgend, United Kingdom",not fake

Richelle S,Indeed a home away from home... Beautiful just Beautiful!!,"Definitely my very last choice since almost all hotels were fully booked at that time but since we were desperate to have a hotel I took the risk.. but I was completely blown away with this beautiful hotel.. judging its location in the middle of a busy city, I never thought a hotel can be this amazing.. Thank You Rodel (front desk) who assisted us for our smooth check-in.. he was very accommodating and very friendly, he even upgraded us in a premium room.. he made sure our stay will be an extra special one... two thumbs up for his great customer service, you made us feel so special and the rest of the team who assisted us throughout our stay.. Room - lovely spacious room with a great view of the city and feels like you are on top of the world and yet we are only at the 39th floor.. oh and the toilet is amazing!Service - outstanding despite the number of guests.. peak season.. the staff managed to give a very good customer service with a smile.. Location - very accessible and just in front of the metro station.. Infinity Pool - although located on the other side of the building, it was simply beautiful... very beautiful.. Felt like we are the royal family so we will surely be back and we can't wait for our next stay!! and I must say this is now my fave hotel out of all the hotels we have tried so far..",07-Jul-16,N/A,not fake

The main thing i want to talk about is the staff. The staff were amazing always willing to help, but mainly they were so pleasant and friendly, especially the staff that were at the concierge desk and the staff at the restaurant. The hotel was beautiful, the food was amazing, but definitely the staff of this hotel made mine and my friends Dubai experience extra special. Me and my friends felt like princesses we didn't want to come back to England. If I do get a chance to go back to Dubai, I will be staying at this hotel again.",03-Jul-16,N/A,not fake

A TripAdvisor M,Home away from home,"This has been one of the best hotel trips I have ever had. I was here for a few days with my mum on my first visit to Dubai & felt so at home without no compromise on luxury! Thanks to the amazing staff (especially Nfor), I briefly mentioned it was my birthday the next day to Ahmed on reception whilst checking in and to my surprise there was a cake & card waiting for me in my room when I returned. The pool was under construction when we arrived which was disappointing as I'd seen pictures & really wanted to use it but the hotel were very accommodating and offered to arrange and pay for a cab to use the pool facility in a near by sister hotel. Luckily the day I wanted to use the pool was the same day it was back in service. The pool has amazing views and I would recommend using the spa (one of the best massages I've had). I had an unfortunate incident where by a local guest in the hotel kept 'offering' himself to me despite my obvious disgust and followed me around the hotel when my mother had gone out; which made me feel extremely uncomfortable and obviously vulnerable in a foreign country, but once I reported this to the concierge, security was immediately informed and my room and floor was watched. Which removed any previous fear I had. I was really impressed how seriously the allegations were taken and how quickly they all worked together to resolve and reassure me of the rarity of this type of situations and my safety. There literally is nothing I could fault, we stayed in a beautiful twin premier room with the best view of sheik al zayed road. It's in an amazing location, the metro station is right Infront of the hotel, Dubai mall is a 5-7min drive; with varied shopping, the Dubai fountains, Burj Khalifa and under water aquarium. There's also a ton of eateries around the hotel so you are spoilt for choice in the rare case you get tired of the hotels deliciously extensive in room dining or onsite restaurants. The lobby and hotel had such a unique smell that we spent half our trip trying to get the chemical company that provides the air fresheners & floor cleaners to sell us some of the products to come home with!The staff are extremely friendly and attentive, I think we ended up tipping them all because they were so pleasant! I have already referred the hotel to all my family and friends (even though I've only been back ten hours) and I honestly can't wait to return soon in the near future! Thank you all for creating such a memorable trip & I will be returning soon!", 25 June 2016 ,N/A,not fake

Front desk agent,rodel, is friendly.. Room is big with huge windows and a nice view. I love the tub and overall layout of bathroom suitable for couples. I could have rated it 5 stars if it was immaculately clean and properly maintained..bed sheet was too short and not tucked in, no toothbrush, only 1 set of amenities for 2 people, no toothbrushes and water pressure was too strong/unstable.

The atmosphere is everything especially when looking at the view from your room at night or even the infinity pool. The staff is wonderful! Extra helpful and friendly! When your arrive tippy absolutely MUST get a smoothly from the Cafe in the lobby. Caf_ staff address you by name and really make toy feel at home. When you arrive ask for Tariq!

For anyone visiting Dubai for the first time this hotel was in a great location with most things only a 10-15 minute taxi ride, the food was great and if you want to wander outside the hotel there's several supermarkets nearby and food restaurants.The food in the hotel was also lovely and all of the hotel staff especially Kristel were a delight.

Victoria A,"Excellent hotel, highly recommended.","Came with my mum for 5 nights in the beginning of May for our first time to Dubai. The hotel is excellently located to explore the city, a little further from the palm (which we found quite disappointing anyway - so much construction going on) but easy access to public beaches by taxi which the staff were more than happy to organise for us and I think the fare was £5 or less! The front door of the hotel to the metro station entrance was about 4 steps.Our room was beautiful, we were given a city facing room on the 46th floor with the most incredible view of downtown and the burj. Thankyou very much to the reception staff for organising that for us. We were provided with refreshments while we waited for the room to be ready (we chose to wait for the higher floor; but there were other rooms available when we arrived if we didn't want to wait). The room was spotless and kept that way by the housekeeping staff for our whole stay and whenever we encountered them they were extremely helpful, polite and cheerful. We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel, so much choice and variety for both meals and there were different offerings every day. Breakfast seemed to be busy whatever time we arrived but we never had to wait for a table and there was always plenty of food, dinner on the other hand was always quiet. We were probably 2 of a maximum of 10 people eating every night. We didn't get round to trying the a la Carte menu as there was so much choice at the buffet, there was also a lot of effort gone into different themes for the food some nights. The staff were so attentive, you'd barely put down your cutlery or glass of water before they were over removing your plate or refilling your glass.As others reviews state the pool was a little hard to find on top of the adjacent car park but looking around this seemed to be normal in this area of Dubai. It is smaller but absolutely adequate for what is required, the lifeguards were always cheerful providing towels and a weather update. Never a problem getting a sunbed space anytime of day (or night).Overall we cannot recommend the hotel highly enough, excellent location if you're looking to see some of Dubai, every staff member we encountered the whole time was helpful, polite, knowledgeable and cheerful - an asset to the hotel.

Michael S,I knew itƒ,"I had a lot of reservations booking this hotel, but in the end was given no tea choices. I will not return, but the good and the bad below. THE GOODthe location is excellent for anyone really, even in the summer. There's lots of taxis in the area, and the main entrance is literally a short hop from the metro station meaning no long walks in the summer heat. The room I had (I was upgraded) was large and spacious but not sure what the regular rooms are. I thought I got a good rate (AED500), which is 25% of the advertised rate. I wouldn't pay the full rate, or a smidgen more. THE BADThis hotel is a dry hotel. No bar at all, no alcohol in the mini-bar and not a lot of great options nearby without a longish walk. The food is mediocre and I ended up ordering the same thing most nights. The restaurant I'd avoid, given the general standards of Dubai. For some strange reason I had to keep asking for the mini-bar to be restocked. I used the dry cleaning service, and even though I left my clothes at 6am, they were only returned the following day. I also asked for them to be folded, and they came back on hangars. The buttons on my suit came back broken and one shirt was returned with some buttons missing.", 23 May 2016 ,"London, United Kingdom",not fake

FeeFee44,Oldie but a Goodie,"Despite the hotel being quite old in 'Dubai' terms, the hotel is in a good condition. The rooms are quite small compared to other hotels in the city, but they are clean, tidy and come with a good sized bathroom.The smoking rooms do smell quite smokey so if you are a non smoker I would recommend asking for a non smoking room.The hotel is a dry hotel.",23-May-16,London,not fake

YorkshireShac,Magnificent Place,"Took my wife here for her 50th birthday and we both loved it, a spectacular hotel in the heart of the city. You would never guess this was a city centre hotel it's so quiet and the location is perfect.All the staff are professional, polite and go beyond their normal duties to ensure they offer you the very best service. From the point of checking in to checking out the staff are exemplary.Breakfasts are immense and the choices are superb, the pool side bar is quick to serve and drinks are reasonably priced. The sun loungers are extra comfortable, and there's plenty to go round.We had a fantastic room on the 59th floor and the views were breath taking over the city, (higher the better) we faced the Burj Khalifa which by night was a great sight. Our room was huge, king sized bed, crisp linens and awesome bathroom, all modern amenities are catered for, cannot fault the room at all.The pool area at the rear looks out towards the sea, the whole area is clean and tidy. Highly recommend the place, true 5 star luxury in every way. Personally a big thank you to Assam on reception he made our stay even more enjoyable, he even sent a birthday cake the room for my wife, a true professional and a credit to the hotel.", 21 May 2016 ,Yorkshire,not fake

I booked through Emirates,there was a little confusion with the booking but it got sorted out and the hotel upgraded my room. Every staff member was lovely and very friendly, it would be too hard to name everyone - Shafique was very helpful and is very good at his job, Steven went out of his way to make sure that everything in the room was good, connected up the WiFi for me, made sure that I had enough water, explained how everything functioned in the room and told me where the local shops were located. Steven is so friendly and happy, it was a great welcome to the hotel after a stressful and tiring journey.I loved that the metro was just outside the hotel, made the return journey easier after a long day. The pool and spa were lovely also.",16-May-16,N/A,not fake

Breakfast was OK, but chairs...please renew the furniture in the restaurant!... Swiming pool on the pariking building. Looks a bit strange and not a 5* level while going to it.

The rooms were modern, clean and had terrific views of downtown Dubai. lot's of restaurant options in walking distance. The rooftop pool also had great views of Dubai and was very well maintained. Last but certainly not least, the SUPERIOR customer service received from EVERY member of the hotel staff was outstanding! Everyone was extremely helpful and aimed to ensure I had the perfect dream trip by arranging tours, making reservations to visit Burj Al Arab for Afternoon tea in addition to a host of other arrangements. I must give a HUGE shout out to Tariq in the Caf_. He was always professional, personable and exemplified superior customer service on all levels. In addition to making the best mango smoothies he also provided many suggestions of places I should visit while in Dubai. During the last few days on my trip I was by myself but he was the best conversationalist. Such a wise young man! Anyway...would I visit again? ABSOLUTELY and I will be returning to this hotel.", 10 May 2016,N/A,not fake

The pool however was pretty disappointing because it gets very crowded and the area is pretty small and with a lot of kids and if I was on a romantic stay I wouldn't stay there. The restaurant menu was good but perhaps the level of service and attention to detail was more of a 4 star. The concierge and the attendants were very friendly and said hello to us, some didn't, a bit of inconstancy on that point!

Rob D,Hotel in middle of city,"This hotel was a great find . It is in the middle of the city very clean and quite with big rooms and great pool area. It is a directly in front of the connecting bridge too the public train just 2 stops from Dubai mall . It cost about $1.00 to take a short train ride . The hotel had a good breakfast buffet but does not have any alcohol on site . Alcohol is limited to only some of the hotels and some bars and is quite expensive usually about $15 CND for a basic beer/wine . I suggest bringing your own from the Dubai Duty free or finding a Hotel with a business lounge / snack time if you plan to drink free for a few hours then go out . But be aware being drunk in public is not accepted there. I also stayed at Radisson Blu Media city at the marina area which had a lounge but the pool was not as good . They did however have a nite club on the roof which is nice but its also loud so make sure you stay on the business tower side and take them up on there happy hour free drinks and snacks. Traveling in Dubai is quite easy we used the metro and found it super clean and cheap , be aware the back of the train is for women and kids only , you will be told if you a man and made to move , there is also no gum chewing on the train . If you choose to take a taxi they are also cheap but make sure you stay away front the Lexus taxi as they are 4x the cost . The beaches are nice and can be crowded , I was surprised to see bikini's and short shorts because of their ways there , you will see signs in the malls to make sure you are covered up . In all I don't thing you can find a bad hotel there its so clean in the city just try and find something that suits your needs and enjoy . I know we loved it there with so much to see and do .", 26 April 2016,"toronto, Canada",not fake

The hotel has an amazing breakfast range both middle eastern and western dishes, plenty of choice.

skychaplainm,Stayed for 3 nights as stopover on way home to UK from Australia. Excellent choice!,"Our experience of the Millennium Plaza, Dubai, was really good. We were especially struck by the friendliness and cheerfulness of all the staff - especially those in the lobby, and there were always plenty of staff on hand to assist. Nothing was too much trouble, and they had clearly been expertly trained in customer service.But the hotel had much more to offer - an excellent full breakfast, a lovely swimming pool - with lifeguard present from 0700-2200, and our Premium room upgrade was well worth the money for the uninterrupted view of the sea and Dubai port. (Even a good view of Cunard's old ship QE2!) We were on floor 36 of 64.Lastly, the hotel is great for location - opposite the Emirates Towers metro station, near to Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa tower, and not too far from Dubai Creek, city centre, and the Airport. Be sure, if using taxis, to only use the official branded ones, which are metered.If wanting the same location and facilities, we wouldn't hesitate to return to the Millennium Plaza, Dubai.", 17 April 2016,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",not fake

Tim B,"Good spot, nice room, poor lifts","We chose this hotel based on the reviews. It turned out a good choice and excellent value for money.It is positioned in the business district, right next to the Emirates Tower metro station and a couple of stops from Dubai Mall. It is about 50 AED from the airport.The room, a superior, was excellent. Nice comfy beds, beautiful shower, everything you need.The downside of the hotel is the lifts. They are terribly slow and not enough of them.We had the hotel breakfast. We didn't book it, but was offered a discounted breakfast at checkin (40 AED). So might be worth taking that tactic. The buffet breakfast is nice and worth 40 AED but probably not worth 80 which the usual price.We used the travel desk. Note that this seems to run independently of the hotel, so the tour we had and how it was arranged seemed to be decidedly dodgy. Having said that we did enjoy it.", 17 April 2016 ,"Sydney, Australia",not fake

Modern rooms (with exception of furniture)What could have been better : like other visitors the room I booked indirectly was not available when I checked in unless I wanted a smoking room, so had to downgrade to a single bed. In addition the hotel does not provide free WiFi in rooms by default only in the lobby. Getting to fitness centre is a rather bizarre arrangement, leaving the existing building on the 5th floor ..walking across to a multi storey car park and getting another lift from there. The communal areas are small due to the lift shafts and are quite cramped due to vast swathes of package tour guests hanging around for the wifi.The hotel was adequate for sure, but didn't exude luxury.

Millenium Plaza hotel was conveniently located. It was one of the bes hotelst we've stayed in.One thing that made our experience so enjoyable was the professional staff; from the check-in to check-out. Everyone was always smiling, engaging, friendly and very helpful. Special thanks to the staff who did our check-in (forgot her name) and to Katherine David from the Housekeeping Department. The receptionnist was able to give us a very nice room with a great view in the morning and the Katherine was so quick to response to our needs. These two staff were able to demonstrate their professionalism. We will definitely stay in this hotel to our next visit in Dubai.",11-Apr-16,"Geneva, Switzerland",not fake

MommyCville,The View From Up Here!!,"We stayed here for one night on a layover, on our way from Toronto to Australia, we booked transfers, our room, and a tour through a company in Toronto called Kompas Express that specializes in Dubai stopovers.We could not have been more happier with this hotel, we were on the 42nd floor overlooking the city and WHAT A VIEW, the room was modern updated, the hotel was not newer but very clean and staff were most helpful and very friendly. Breakfast was included and was a wonderful way to start our day. The hotel was not in the downtown core but right on the subway route making getting around very easy. We felt very safe in the area walking around and trying out several restaurants and there was no language barrier as everyone spoke english. After a long day of touring we ended up in the rooftop pool and hot tub which was an awesome end to our day watching the sun set in an infinity pool overlooking the city wearing our supplied robes..

Th3Guy,One of the best I have ever stayed in,"I stayed in this hotel during the summer 2015 and still this - in terms of service - was one of my best hotel experiences. Hotel staff really remember you, smile and do the best to attend your requests. Breakfast was of good choice, taste and quality with middle eastern cuisine as well. The atmosphere is great with a lot of Arabs in their traditional clothing. The pool is not with the best views, but then again one of the largest in comparison to similar hotels. Wifi is affordable and metro accessible (4 metres from the hotel entrance). Shop nearby and some fast-foods. Good for business and leisure (sightseeing, shopping) stay alike.

ColinsweeneY,Great on the outside but,"To be positive the hotel is close to the metro- it's right outside the front door. The room I had enjoyed an excellent view and it was a large one. However, the hotel was booked by my company who forgot to include breakfast. When I asked the reception said I could have a special rate which was fine but only if I paid, which meant I have to claim for it subsequently but also meant I had less on my credit card to spend while in Dubai. Obviously my company preferred this.The hotel is also dry - no alcohol- which would be ok but the only decent food in the area where you can get a drink is in other hotels which may also be dry. The plaza is also surrounded by absolutely every fast food joint you could think of.At the start of my second week I seemed to have lost access to free wifi in my room- the implication was I had to pay from the log in screen. It took three calls to sort it.", 8 April 2016 ,"London, United Kingdom",not fake

mstephens,Great Views,"I stayed at this hotel with my mum and young son age 8 for 3 nights. Due to our flight arrival, we got to the hotel at 0630 hours. The receptionist was very accommodating and we managed to check in early which was very much appreciated after a long haul flight. Though the hotel was clean and good, I certainly don't rate it a 5 star hotel, more a 4 star. Having just come from a 5 star hotel in Hong Kong, this was disappointing. Our room was big and had great views of Burj Khalifa. The bath towels were thin and shabby. They only provided one hand and one face towel for 3 people. One of the days they didn't even provide us with a bath mat! They provide free bottled water.We had breakfast and I would say it is nothing special. The temperature of the food was only luke warm. We booked a private VIP safari trip into the desert for 1100 AED, via the tour guide at the reception due to my mum not participating in the dune bashing. This included dune bashing, camel ride, reserved table and BBQ food served directly to u rather than queuing up. I thought this was good value for money. I choose this hotel due to the location being next door to the metro. This only being two stops away to the Dubai shopping mall. What I didn't realise was that once you got off the stop for Dubai shopping mall. You have to walk some 30 mins before you can even begin to browse at any shops. My advise for any traveller is to use the taxis parked out at the front of the hotel. Taxi are not expensive and quicker. Outside of the hotel there is a small supermarket and a few restaurants close by. We ate at Wagamamma which was a couple of minutes from the hotel. I paid a lot of money staying at this hotel some £230 per night, so I don't think it is of good value.If I return to Dubai I would be visiting another hotel.

RSWW,"Nice hotel, beware of taxi fares!","This is a beautiful hotel, very clean and in a good central location. The staff are very attentive and accommodating.Meals, breakfast in particular, are very extensive and a broad range of tastes is catered for.The only downside was at the end of the stay when a taxi was arranged for us and the fare had obviously been artificially increased to give the hotel a cut. The journey to the airport should have been 50 dirham at the most but was actually 100. The hotel had quoted this figure to us, but as we didn't know how long the journey would be, we couldn't tell if it was a reasonable price or not. The meter wasn't running, and the driver told us the price was set by the hotel.It's not a fortune, but it's the principle that matters and leaves a bad taste after what had been a pleasant stay.",04-Apr-16,"Leicester, United Kingdom",not fake

Giacomo G,OH MY SHOES,"Good location. We love the neighborhood and there is a nice shisha bar (horrible interior design but good food and shisha) around the corner. Lobby is small but OK entrance is not so visible. Room is OK large with a nice view. But very poor materials and unfortunately not that clean. The worst thing happen immediately the first night. As soon as i have arrived late afternoon i left my shoes out the door for cleaning. Morning time i woke up and found my shoes exactly in the same location as previous night, not cleaned.... It's OK, i told myself, I will do it by myself. I open a shoe cleaner provided by hotel and as soon as i wipe the product my shoes I dark stain marked the nice brown leather with a dark matt horrible color. I have called the reception and someone came up to try to settle, but couldn't make it. He told me that probably this produxt is for BLACK leather shoes. But why is TRANSPARENT color and WHY THIS IS NOT MENTIONED ON THE PRODUCT packaging???? Damn i got so hungry. Ok i keep my new nice 600usd boots with a stain on it for the whole week, i have no choice that's the only pair i have. The funny thing happened the next day, when a very nice and beautiful lady working at lobby asked my how was my stay. I told her the story... The manager was there, said sorry, try to arrange. Alright i told him, try to clean my shoes and remove is stain, tonight I will leave them out from my room... I did, and found the shoes exactly the same position, untouched. The gentlemen manager delivered his apologize and a plate of fruit to my room..: thank you. But i expected (but i have not asked) a big discount on my stay as i was also paying quite a high rate (i have booked at the check in) compared to my other colleagues which where staying in the same hotel. This hotel is a budget hotel, do not do there if you are looking for special experience. And specially if you have nice brown leather shoes or boots!!! OMG", 10 March 2016 ,N/A,not fake

I didn't have a problem at all with regards to my transaction. He even upgraded me to a better room. Which I greatly appreciated.After taking my hotel card we went to our room and we were stunned with the gorgeous set-up of the room and the privacy it has and most especially the superb view at our window where we had a wonderful view of the skyline on Sheik Zayed Road.The breakfast was mouth watering as there were options to choose from. I especially like the freshly cooked omelette which I pair with my vegetarian rice & cooked eggplant with special sauce. Being too full from the breakfast we went back our room and spend more in the bed to sleep and relax before we go to the pool to have fun with our kid.Though we didn't have much time to spend on the pool we still enjoyed it so much. As the pool was relaxing and had a modern infinity pool type. Our kid enjoyed it so much that he still wanted to stay longer, but unfortunately it was time for us to leave.Overall, as my first staycation in a hotel, that was a really great experience that I wanted to do again and again.", 6 March 2016,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",not fake

I 've been in simillar case and I was offered a free dinner once and a free message.The room was generally clean and wide, the bathroom was big with rain shower and a tap but the hot water was warm not hot and they did not provide a teeth cleaning kit.The elevators of the hotel are really a big issue, one time I waited for 5 minutes to get into one !!! The gym of the hotel is average, good for fitness seekers bad for bodybuilders, not fully equipment and the weights are few.The best thing about the hotel is the location, it is located in shaikh Zayed road between the old dubai and the new dubai, and it is 10 minutes away from the airport, there is a metro station located exactly in the front of the hotel.There are couple of supermarkets and restaurants near the property.5 minutes drive from burj Khalifa", 2 March 2016,N/A,not fake

The rooftop infinity pool was very nice and we spent most evenings unwinding at it.The hotel is located directly opposite the Emirates Towers Metro station and it is only 2 stops from the Dubai Mall. Perfectly located!!The only criticism we had was that the dinner menu was a buffet and was very expensive. Needless to say we took a short stroll down the street and ate at one of many nearby restaurants.This hotel doesn't serve alcohol although we bought a bottle of Rum in the airport so that we could have a few night caps in our room. Other than that we didn't really miss alcohol so it wasn't an issue for us.We would definitely recommend this hotel.", 1 March 2016,"County Dublin, Ireland",not fake

But at least it was renovated. I can't fault the rooms. I did not enjoy the breakfast. I did not find it to be world standard. It was edible and I had to look very carefully to find anything I thought was good. I may just be too fussy.I also missed a lounge for business meetings or just getting out of the room. It has a coffee area, but not an official business lounge. I missed that. I don't think it is a business traveler hotel. I did not use the gym, nor the pool area, but I'm told it is good.Ask for the ocean view. I had a view of the city and desert, which was fine.",29-Feb-16,"Sandton, South Africa",not fake

Our wish to get room in the upper floor with Burj Khalifa view was well taken and we enjoyed the great view from the 46th floor. The always warm infinity pool and the jacuzzi was great and we enjoyed the late opening hours too. The breakfast was great, I would say, every culture could find their taste. Nice appearance. A very special thank you to Kristel who comfort us every morning with her very warm welcome and our special breakfast needs. Andrea and Martina, the ladies from Germany saying hello to you! One thing which should be improved in the room, that the hairdryer is not fixed in the Office desk in the room. This should be in the nice, spacious bathroom :-). Wondering who designed this. And as mentioned by others as well, free WiFi should be available in the room too, not just in the lobby.Thanks also to the Concierge, they all do a great job, helping us, being so friendly and patient, a personal thanks to John helping me with my print-outs. We had an absolutely great time, the Hotel is located just in front of the Emirate Towers Metro Station, which was convenient to go up and down Dubai all the time.", 28 February 2016,Neu-Ulm,not fake

Dubai mall is 10 minutes away by car, the metro station is 20 meters away form the front door.Secondly the amenities are luxurious, the bath tub is just incredible; it is so big and has a window that could be opened directly on the living/sleeping room, and hence you'll have an amazing scene of Dubai beaches while you are relaxing in the tub..magnificent experience.not to forget the helpful, welcoming and continuously smiling staff.",28-Feb-16,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",not fake

The maintenance of the hotel is quite good. The bed is really comfortable and I had a great stay. The hotel is just next to the metro station. Restaurants are just along the street. Burj Khalifa & Dubai mall are just 2 stations away. There is a mini mart and a medical center just next to the hotel. The breakfast is good! They have a good variety of food. I only have a slight complaint on the house keeping. The timing is not very consistent and sometimes things are not replaced. (i.e. floor mat missing, the chocolate milk I spilled on the floor is not cleared, shampoo is not replaced, etc) I had even had a staff knocking on my door at 10pm to request to check the mini bar. I rejected and the staff asked me why? Well, I said because it's late and he politely said he would come back the next day. However, I really wanted to give a compliment to one of the staff that helped me clean up my room. Her name is Winnie. She is very a detailed person. I never complained when she was on duty. She even helped me to fold my clothes. What did I do to deserve that? Thank you Winnie. I didn't manage to thank her in person before I left.", 26 February 2016,"Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia",not fake

Larissa C,outstanding staff,"Before coming to Dubai, my friend and I discussed for a long time where to stay. Close to the Jumeirah area in the west or in the old part town in the east. Finally we made a compromise and chose the Millenium Hotel. The location is perfect, 5 second walk to the entrance of the metro station, right in the middle of the popular spots and only a short ride to the huge mall.The room was much bigger than I anticpated, with a huge window in the room and in the bathroom (!), and everything was super clean. The only bad thing about the room was that there was a constant noise. At first we thought it was the air conditioning. But after turning everything off, air conditioning, fan, lights, it was still there. The only solution was to be extremely exhausted at night, other wise falling asleep would take forever because of that. That is why my review is missing one point. The breakfast was fantastic! There was so much to choose from the buffet, fruits, cereal, pita, hummus, cheese, bread... and there was also someone there to make an omelet for you or simple fried egg. Since we came during ramadan and weren't too sure whether we could make it to the evening without food, we ate lots of the healthy dishes..The area around the pool was either under construction or not yet done, but the water was cool and clean, the lounge chairs as well, got extra towels and the view was on the impressive line of tall hotel/buildings and the local housing area with white mosques in the skyline.However the staff was outstanding. Always polite, always helpful and remembered us and out small talks (where we went that day, what we thought about it, what our suitcases looked like when we went to pick them up before our flight...), breakfast preferences, and SMILES!The only thing I regret not doing while at my stay at the Millennium Plaza hotel was to not be back at the hotel for sunset. Viewing the red sun setting over the beach area from the pool must be beautiful...", 19 February 2016,"Osaka, Japan",NO FAKE

Pryesh,Services could improve,Stayed there for business on the night of the 13th of Feb. My office told me that payment had been made whilst reception told me that it wasn't. It turned out that the payment method of our booking agent was declined but they were not notified probably due to poor communication between the reservation desk and the reception. I was on the 34th floor but could not find out the menu at the pool bar so could not be bothered to go. On the whole good for business but not so good if you have surprises on having to make a payment. Checking out was lousy. My bill was never emailed to me and whilst I checked out in the morning they went through another lengthy procedure whilst my wife checked out.

We enjoyed the infinity pool and the fact that our location was central to everything.On the morning of our departure my husband fell ill and had to be taken by ambulance to Rashid Hospital. It was quite a shock but the entire staff at the hotel were just amazing. From porters, to front desk to managers; I could not have asked for more. Efficient, kind and understanding. Fortunately, after four days we got clearance to fly and all was well. Those first two days were very difficult and the staff found me a lovely room at a proper rate and assisted me in every way with dealing with the airlines, hospital etc. Thank you, Nabil, Anu, Ayeshia Faizl and so many more...",17-Feb-16,"New York City, New York",not fake

I was equally impressed by a lady whom I found at the reception when I checked in on the wee hours (around 2 am on 11th) when I arrived and she helped to extend my booking for an extra night even though we had only booked for one night and needed to be in Dubai for an additional day. I stayed in room 57009 and I liked the view it offers and is very ideal for a good sleep. The room amenities are average but functional.

Cotswolders,"Fabulous hotel, great location","Stayed here in January 2016 for 4 nights. The hotel is on the main Sheikh Zayed Road, right next to a metro stop. There is a bus stop and 'hop on hop off' city sightseeing stop just outside the hotel. The Burj Khalifa and shopping mall are 2 metro stops away. So convenient for transport for getting about the city as it is not an easy city to walk. Taxis passing all the time.If you use the metro you have to get on/off at the Emirates Tower stop for The Millennium Plaza. You have to use metro link walkway going across over the Sheikh Zayed Road. It is not possible to cross anywhere on this road as there are 12 lanes. You have to use a metro link cross over.Sounds complicated but once you are there you will see what I mean!Stayed on the 61st floor on sea side, therefore no traffic noise and great views all the way to Burj al Arab and towards the creek, although rather hazy. Rooms on the city side face Sheikh Zayed Road, Burj Khalifa, and Emirates Towers.Huge room with television in middle of sitting area and bedroom. Free wifi. Tea making facilities. Large bathroom with rain shower, toilet, bidet. Separate bath tub and bathroom area. The bathroom shutters open up into the bedroom if you wish (to watch television in the bath!)Fabulous cheeseburgers delivered by room service after an exhausting day out. Large comfortable king bed but the lighting could be a bit brighter.Large reception area on the ground floor. Breakfast room (good selection buffet style food - hot and cold - omlettes etc cooked to order) on 5th floor. There is a link corridor from the breakfast room over to another building where the spa and pool are also level with 5th floor with a car park underneath it. From our room on the 61st floor we could look down onto the pool which for most of the day was completely in shade from the tower of the hotel. So not really practical to lie by the pool all day or even after a busy day sightseeing. Shame really lovely infinity pool.You can buy tickets and book trips from the lady in reception. The hotel porter can get you a taxi but it is far cheaper if you step outside the hotel door and flag one down yourself.", 9 February 2016,N/A,NOT FAKE

Only one minus, a smoking room, not aired! But it's not a problem! If I go back to Dubai, I will certainly stay in this hotel! I advise everyone to this wonderful hotel!

Perhaps alcoholics may not like this hotel as it is not served!. These factors impressed me to stay again in Feb 2015 but was unsuccessful!

Simon S,Not as '5 star' as other 5 star hotels in Dubai!,"I stayed here for 7 nights whilst attending a trade show at the nearby World Trade Centre and overall it was a disappointing experience, certainly when compared to other hotels in Dubai which I have stayed at.Check in took ages, even though it was 1am and I was the only guest arriving. They said that they only had smoking rooms available (despite a non-smoking room having been booked) and then, all of a sudden, a non-smoking room appeared after I complained. The room itself was large but rather featureless. It was on the 38th floor and faced the main road so whilst the view was good, the noise from the road was not! The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The bathroom was a good size with a separate bath and shower although the shower cubicle door did not shut properly and the shower control was awkward to use due to the positioning of the additional water hose. One the first two days of my stay there was no bath mat so I had to use a hand towel and the bath towels provided were thin and on two occasions, badly stained. Breakfast was disappointing, a reasonable choice but nothing particularly exciting and the coffee was, I think, the worst I have ever tasted - absolutely foul!!! (The tea was not much better either). Service was also slow or non-existent some mornings. The restaurant on the 5th floor was a rather uninspiring room, certainly not what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. I had dinner on one evening which was served outside by the pool. This was a buffet but there was a rather limited choice of starters and mains (lots of puddings though) and the quality was variable. The rooftop pool is nice but only has a limited number of sunbeds so I would think could get quite crowded in the height of the season. The staff were generally all very pleasant and helpful. WiFi is free but limited to two devices per room which is annoying and inconvenient. The speed was not that great either.The other think to note about this hotel is that it is 'dry' (no alcohol served), unlike almost all other 4/5 star hotels in Dubai. I would not choose to stay here again when there are so many other, better hotels available in Dubai, often for a cheaper price too.",01-Feb-16,"Norwich, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

I guess that this is the only 5 star feature of the hotel. Nothing, starting with room cleaning reached a minimum. I've had to call 3 days to request towels as they would take the dirty ones without replacement. Breakfast is OK, but it sometimes takes ages to get a coffee. The buffet available for dinner is simply not edible, so bad! And the staff can be really friendly or not even pay attention, it depends on your luck.

Abdullah A,THE WORST HOTEL EVER,"This hotel deserves to get something under one star I wish I could give it zero stars. First of all this hotel is not even designed as a hotel it's one of those that are designed for something else. Once we checked in there was this rude person her name was Svetlana she is really rude we requested two connected rooms and she said this is only a request it doesn't mean we can do it we can not do it if we want then we asked if there is another room she told us there was a suite on the 58th floor but then she started lowering and raising the price of the room by herself and then she told us it was a smoking room which we didn't want so we told her to call the manager. When the manager came we told him everything and then he gave us the executive suite which was the best they had. The suite was big but wasn't clean and the bathrooms were filthy and then we ordered room service every single thing we ordered was full of spices it's like they have the whole world supply of spices. The elevators were small and really slow so if you have a meeting or something and you need to get there quick I recommend you take the stairs. This hotel is like a maze because it's not built as a hotel and it's not even safe if there is an emergency. What really made me mad at these rude people that they tricked us on the amount of money we had to pay the room we booked for we were supposed to pay 740 dollars for it but instead they tricked us when we checked in they told us that the suite they gave us will be the same price we booked for but they are liars they made us pay 1,900 dollars. When we checked out is was the same person that checked us in and she told us ""Did you like your stay with us?"" We told her no and she told us why and she's still asking why after all that happened to us with their stupid hotel. She then called another different manager who asked why did't you like your stay and we told him and he told us maybe we can sort things out maybe you can come to stay at our hotel and it will be better. We told them this time was the first and last time we will stay at their hotel and we will never ever ever come back and what annoyed us that they didn't want us to be mad. How do they want us not to be mad? This hotel is one of the worst I have been to and they don't deserve anything you pay them and I don't recommend this hotel to anybody ever, and also you have to pay for the wifi with all of that money you are paying.", 29 January 2016,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",NOT FAKE

Mahmoud I,Absolutely terrible.,"The so called hotel was one of the worst hotels I have visited in my life .No proper reception lounge is available, I believe this was not designed or built as a hotel because of the rooms layout and the elevators that requires more time to serve you. The receptionist was not well trained it's obvious that she wants to charge for everything even if you have requested it , what was missing is to charge you for breathing. the rooms was not cleaned nor the breakfast was good . The WiFi was very poor and its limited to number of guest per room. For first time traveler or for people with less travel experience this hotel may be ok but surely not for me .", 29 January 2016 ,N/A,not fake

kailuuu,Good starting point to visit modern Dubai,"The hotel is conveniently located just in front of Dubai Metro station. Hotel staff is very polite and helpful, a special thanks to Hassan the Egyptian receptionist: he proposed us some upgrades that after a little bargain revealed to be advantageous like a bigger room (60th floor with a beautiful view on Jumeirah beach and the sea - I reccommend this side because on the other side there is Sheikh Zayed Rd. with its traffic and noise) and wifi + breakfast that turned to be very good and we could arrive to dinner skipping lunch. Hassan knows Dubai also very well so I guess Millennium Plaza should take care of him! The hotel is nice and clean, our room was big and with a huge bed and bathroom, during the night there was total silence and housekeeper in the morning never disturbed with noise in the corridor. Breakfast is huge even if in Christmas time or during holidays the restaurant can be crowded but the personnel is very efficient, polite and always smiling. The lounge at 61 floor is also very nice even if breakfast is more complete at the restaurant. Swimming pool too small for a so big hotel even if conveniently located on the sunny and quiet sea side. Wi-Fi not free is ridiculous in a so expensive hotel and the fact that for New Year's Day's night they charge three times the normal price is not a pro. It's anyway a place I would suggest if going to Dubai expecially for the very good position and for the friendly staff: thanks Dane for the hotel car to Abu Dhabi found in 2 minutes!", 28 January 2016,Verbania,not fake

worzelle,Back Again and Just as Superb,"We visited the Millennium Plaza Hotel in Dubai for a one night stopover on our way out to Sydney in September [previously reviewed] Then we had two night stopover there on the way back to the UK at the end of October.I had requested an early check -in on the first visit and the hotel provided this for us. I asked before we left if we could request another early check-in for our return visit going home. Although they could not guarantee this, reception staff were so helpful and the rooms we had there were lovely, especially on the trip home. The staff are really friendly and make you feel very welcome. For the price of this hotel which is very reasonable for Dubai, I don't think you can beat it. Taxis are cheap and run outside the hotel and the Hop-On Hop-Off stop is not very far away.We ate each day in the Atrium Caf_ on the ground floor, the Business Breakfast was equivalent of £8 and was great value. They even ordered me Gluten Free Bread for the return trip. Dessere who served us each time was a lovely girl and very efficient and hard working.On the last day we only had a few hours to pass before we had to go to the airport, so we went up to the roof and I went for a swim. The infinity pool was like a warm bath and I was only sorry that we were not staying longer so I could have used it again.", 27 January 2016,"Frome, United Kingdom",not fake

The staff try hard to please, but the young lady in the club lounge never smiled worked on her own and found it difficult to cope with customers. We tried to eat breakfast on level 5 one morning and although the spread was greater than the club lounge we could not find a table and the noise level was extreme. so it was the least of the two evils back to the club lounge quite, very little food and bad coffee.",,,

NishanaA,Wonderful Holiday Experience,"IÍm writing this review currently from the States and IÍm still in total awe by the level of courtesy, respect and helpfulness received during our stay. The Millennium Plaza hotel staff (from concierge, door staff to restaurant staff) were without exception always very welcoming and courteous. I would like to specifically point out Hassan as he welcomed us with such a great spirit and actually recognized my voice as I called prior to my arrival with a few inquiries related to my stay. I didn't realize and was pleasantly surprised that he remembered and paid attention to those details. He was extremely kind and continued to check in to make sure our stay was pleasant. I travel often and that level of personalization is not always received in many establishments and I was highly impressed by that behavior. If you plan to stay here you should definitely reach out to him for assistance. A point to note it that this is a dry hotel--no alcohol and to get an alcoholic drink is not so easy but that would not deter me from staying here again. The Spa services are reasonably priced and the facility is very clean and the girls are super friendly. I would caution you to pay attention to your check-in time as my service was cut short and when questioned they did not seem to care which was a bummer but still a nice service. Overall, the hotel is in a great location with clean, modern rooms, great views if you are on the premium levels and the metro stop is right out front so itÍs very easy to get around by rail.

westeam,"Excellent hotel and location but beware it is a ""dry"" establishment","Enjoyed an excellent stay over Christmas - even the hotel lobby had a real 2 metre high gingerbread house as well as a Xmas tree and other decorations.The location is convenient as the low cost metro rail station is on the opposite side of the road - you cannot cross the 12 lane carriageway main road on foot but there is bridge right outside the hotel.Also there is a bus stop outside the hotel and a hop-on hop-off tourist bus which runs every 20'ish minutes during the day to give you a good idea what to see and perhaps what to return to see in more detail.Just beware that road traffic can be horrendously snarled up even in the early hours of the morning so travel may take much longer than expected.The Millenium Plaza hotel staff (from concierge, door staff to restaurant staff) were without exception always very welcoming and courteous and I cannot remember better service than this even in the Far East.Our Premium Room was on the 42nd floor overlooking the sea and low lying buildings with a far distant view towards the Atlantis Palm and Jumeirah Beach as well as the sad sight of the ex- Cunard liner QE2 in Port Rashid dock.Our room had a modern separate shower and separate toilet with bidet plus a bath and wash basin all with good lighting. This good lighting did not extend to the large darker main room although there were small LED bedside reading lights as well as other general lighting plus a good size television with satellite channels.WiFi in the lobby is free but you pay if you want this in your room.Furnishings and carpet and floor were all very clean as were the bathroom areas.The air conditioning was quiet and efficient - obviously the skyscraper windows do not open.There is a fitness centre, beauty salon, sauna and pool connected by a bridge in the adjacent parking building. Whilst the infinity pool was okay for us, it was of a limited size and only had 22 loungers around it which might be insufficient in a busy period.One night that we stayed, the evening dinner as an experiment was held adjacent to the pool but the second evening the weather was too damp and chilly (yes Dubai in December somewhat unusually!) so it reverted to the usual 5th floor restaurant.Breakfast had a good self-service buffet and if so wished, freshly cooked-to-order egg dishes (sometimes up to a 5 minute wait in a queue).Restaurant staff were mostly very good - we were very impressed by the service and friendly helpfulness of Kristel, Tariq and Silva. Two very minor downsides of the hotel were the very busy breakfast time which could mean waiting for a table - also at the same time due to numbers of people and number of floors, a wait for a lift.Evening meals were primarily of a good buffet - but beware, this is a dry hotel with no alcohol - the hotel's special Christmas Eve Dinner was celebrated with glasses of ""best oasis"" water although soft drinks are available!This hotel claims to be the most recently built so perhaps the fire standards are more up to date than that of the Address Hotel in Dubai which caught fire this December 2015.Would happily stay here again.", 3 January 2016,"Richmond, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

Lisa M,It's a dry hotel,"We stayed here for two nights for New Year's. Last room downtown we could find. Great location and clean, modern rooms. The metro stop is right out front. Beware that this is a dry hotel--no alcohol. The closest place to get a good drink with great views is the Level 43 Rooftop at the Sheraton Four Points, about a 10-minute walk. Dubai is a very large, spread out city, and it's not pedestrian/walking friendly.", 3 January 2016 ,"Santa Rosa, California",NOT FAKE

WWtravelerUSA,Its all about location!,"Location of this hotel literally steps from a metro station is great. Easy access from the metro stop to just about any place in the city. The hotel is 65 stories high and there are a limited number of hotel rooms on each floor. We booked a premium room, which was very spacious, and since we were on the 38th floor had great views to the ocean. The bathroom is very large with a separate soaking tub and shower. Previous guests have commented on mold in the shower. This was the case in our room. It is more of an eyesore than a health hazard. It is puzzling to me as to why they have not done anything about it. The mold is growing on the stone that is constantly wet from the shower so I am assuming it is hard to treat. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet at night. We booked the bed and breakfast rate that was worth it for one of the days we were there. We had a very early flight departure on departure day and since the breakfast was not open until 6:30AM were not able to take advantage on the last day. If you were to purchase breakfast at the hotel as a stand alone it was over 30.00USD per person which seems very high although the breakfast was excellent quality with both Western and Middle Eastern options available. The pool at the hotel was very nice although it is on the small side for the size property. (The second day was very crowded with many guests wanting to use the pool.)",01-Jan-16,USA,not fake

However the hotel itself is bit tired as well as the rooms. Small defects here and there. Overall impression of the building is more like 4 stars.Room and bathroom was big and interesting detail was ability to be able to bath and see the spectacular view from our 53rd floor window. Breakfast is very good having myriad choices of different thing to pick from. This was ok hotel but we still missed the 5-star overall experience.",01-Jan-16,Helsinki,not fake

Fathiya A,Loved the hotel but....!!,"I booked from 16.12 till 22.12/15 for 6 nights at this hotel, loved the location, the room and the view from the room also their breakfast which gave variety of food, good service, smiling faces, and didn't face any problem at all and didn't have any complaint but... at the moment to pay the bill as the hotel don't charge the amount we have booked online only after leaving the hotel, they gave me a bill which was not convincing for the amount which I paid and they added to it extra charges for the room rate at the night!!!! I called them to clarify everything as I thought there must be a mistake but the lady at the hotel said that when I paid online, I didn't know the room rate except in total!!!! how is that possible?!!!! I booked through booking.com and it gave me the rate for the room BD 67-68 per night.. my total amount for the room to be paid was BD. 407.52 only plus room charges daily which was DH 120 in total, BD 12 only, adding to it and would be BD. 419 + room service, dinner ordered DH 189, internet Dh 100 = BD 447 in total amount the hotel should have charged me. But the amount they'd charged me in total was BD. 571.335!!!! I didn't have the time to check or calculate in the same time when they gave me the bell but I did when I came back home to find how they charged for the room per night with different amount than what I have paid for online!!! every night had a different rate!! at the reception they said to me: every night has a different rate!!! now how is that possible and I booked online for a total amount of Bd. 407.52!!! that ruined my mood and made me hesitate to book again at this hotel in future, although during my stay.. I said to myself: If am going to visit Dubai again so I will choose this hotel again! I travelled a lot and to many destinations in this world but this is the first time happening to me as I never saw any hotel in this world would say: our rooms have a different rate every night!!!! on 21/12 they charged me DH 1,040.00!!!!! more than BD 100!!!!",24-Dec-15,Manama,NOT FAKE

Beat F,Nice 4* Hotel if access to the executive lounge 5*,"We (2 adults and 2 Kids - 2 & 5 Years old) stayed now second time in that hotel. The location is just perfect, out of the front door and 10 second later you're already in the metro station (5-6m to walk). The lobby is okay for such a hotel the rooms nice - especially if you have a corner room at a high floor. Not so nice (in our opinion maximal worth 3*) is the breakfast and dinner buffet restaurant. If you prefer Arabian food guess then 4* are also okay. But I really recommend to upgrade (at the reception when you check in) to a room with access to the club lounge at the top floor. The interior from the lounge is 4*, but the lounge is mostly empty, so quiet and with a great view. They serve a very good and fresh breakfast buffet there (omelets and so they'll order for you). Most of the staff from the Lounge is really friendly (some Russians are friendly some not). They also have a nice snack buffet in the afternoon - so really worth to upgrade. And because the rooms are nice, the location great and if you don't have to eat in the main restaurant, we'll give 5* to this hotel - go for it you'll also like it.",21-Dec-15,"Zurich, Switzerland",not fake

E K,Great Stopover,"My Husband and I stayed in a Superior Room for one night while in transit. We got in very late (1am-2am), but thankfully Dubai never sleeps. We were picked up from the airport, checked in to our room and even ordered room service, all of which was delivered in a friendly, cheerful manner.The Superior Room was comfortable and clean, and although there was a robe missing, we were promptly brought another. The view was nothing spectacular, we were facing nothing in particular. It was a bit of an inconvenience that wifi was not included in the room price.Room service was very nice, but if you like a wine with dinner then this is not the hotel for you as it is a dry hotel. It was ok since we were only staying for one night.Breakfast the next morning was also nice, plenty to choose from at the buffet, pastries, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, cold meats & cheeses, eggs and beef ""bacon"" and other hot dishes. Although it was Ramadan at the time we were not made to feel awkward by eating after sunrise. The Metro restaurant had a nice view of Sheikh Zayed Road from a mid-range level.We asked if we could go take a look from the Club Lounge located on the 61st floor to get the best view from this hotel, from here we could see the Burj Khalifa and also the sea.Enjoyed our stay at Millennium Plaza Hotel Dubai.", 18 December 2015,N/A,not fake

Kelly H,Poor for the Price!!,"I never write reviews as I do believe it's personal taste and what one person may think isn't acceptable, another does.. The experience I received from this hotel was exceptionally poor.I was a single traveller stopping off in Dubai on my way back from South Africa and was looking forward to what I thought would be a bit of luxury..On arrival at 7am after my flight over I had requested an early check in and Booking.com had confirmed my email to the hotel.They said to get this I would have to upgrade as Booking.com apparently hadn't forwarded this message on?! I was exhausted and thought OK fine. Then they said well it'll be smoking, I'm asthmatic and stated I wasn't sure, which I was advised it wouldn't smell and it will be cleaned to a high standard. The stench when I stepped off the lift was overpowering and the room was just the same with no air ventilation. I had to call down and say this and they sent someone in to spray the room. Smelt nice, but after my snooze I woke to a bad smell again. I had to call down about not being able to stay in the room and was told they would clean it for me. This continued throughout my stay. Eventually a member of staff gave me an air freshener as they said there was no room available to move me to.As I was travelling on my own I decided to go half board. The food was cold on both evenings and exactly the same! Being a 5 star hotel in Dubai I expected a better standard of food & quality and was most disappointed! I was in & out in ten minutes both times, the Manager could tell I wasn't happy. I also had a problem with the lights not turning off in my room, I called staff up a couple of times and they all couldn't figure out how to turn them off?! So I had to try and sleep with them on!When I mentioned I had the above problems on check out and I had to call down numerous times they said my satisfaction was important and would refund me the upgrade. I thought OK, that's decent that's only £40, but it's a nice gesture - I wasn't looking for money I wanted to see how I go about passing my complaints to Management, so it didn't happen to anyone else.It's a month since I stayed and I've never received the refund. I followed it up and they said it was an oversight and they would process it.. Nothing..I think this hotel offers poor service and took advantage of dumping me in an awful room as I was on my own.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for the price you pay. I spoke to people who paid a lot less than I did for a much better service & standard elsewhere.", 15 December 2015 ,N/A,NOT FAKE

Harj K,Fantastic location,"I stayed in the Millennium Plaza for 4 days on the way back from Thailand to the UK whilst celebrating a big birthday. The hotel was great as I got upgraded and had a birthday cake waiting for me in my room which was just a fantastic touch.The room was spacious and very clean with a great view especially at night. The hotel itself is ideally located and very central being opposite the Emirate Towers Metro Station and only two stops away from the Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa. The hotel staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful especially and individual named Tariq who was only duty one evening in the cafe on the ground floor and very kindly arranged for the chef to make a vegetarian curry for my wife which was off menu. Only negatives war:- Breakfast time was sometimes very busy and you had to get your own table with the service a little slow but I guess you would expect that at a large hotel - The room although spacious and clean looked a little tired. - Dinner in the restaurant was just over 100 AED for a buffet and a little expensive with as much cheaper options available outside within walking distanceOther than is it was a fantastic first experience and I would definitely stay here again.",14-Dec-15,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

Galliano16,Nice but definitely not a 5 star hotel,"Having been a couple of times in Dubai I would say that the standard of the country is under many aspects much higher than several European countries, therefore from a 5 star hotel in Dubai I do expect to find the same standard as in Europe. Having said that, here my impressions after staying 5 nights at the Hotel Millennium Plaza, Dubai.For visiting Dubai the location is great, very central and very near to the metro station.Positive: the staff was throughout the whole hotel very friendly, the room was spacious (I booked a superior room for my wife and myself with a bed and breakfast accommodation).The food was good, the variety of the breakfast buffet really large, the choice however definitively not at the level of a 5 star hotel. Following points were very disappointing, some of them would disappoint me in any hotel of any category, no matter in which country the hotel is located and actually a ""no go"" for a ""5 star "" hotel:The room:- Mould in the shower- The waste bin in the bathroom was ""disgusting""- One of the 2 armchairs had a very visible stainThe breakfast room:- Several tables were wobbly, one morning we changed 3 tables- The cover was always missing something: side plates, spoons,... - Some waiter used to pick up the cups putting the fingers inside- Not very exemplary for his team: the head-waiter dropped once a knife, just picked it up from the floor and put it on the table.I myself have a hotel background and surely notice such things more than other people, my wife - without a background in the hotel sector - did not find such things really amusing neither.My and my wife's conclusion: booking at the Millennium Plaza do not expect, as we did to, stay in a real 5 star hotel. Expect to stay in a well run European 3 to max. 4 stars hotel and you should not be disappointed.", 13 December 2015,Darmstadt,not fake

I was so grateful and shocked that I couldn't wait to explore my suite. The suite was awesome nice views of the city and my bathroom with the tub I think I could've stayed in for hours. The living area was separate and I really enjoyed the comfortable bed for a couple of hours before take off... The hotel even took me to the airport free of charge.

Paul W,"Great location, but frustrating experience staying here","I stopped at the Millennium Plaza hotel for 4 nights. I had booked a Superior king size room about 9 mths previous. When I arrived I was given the impressionthey didn't have this room ready. I was instantly offered an upgrade for additional cost, figures were thrown at me, first for an upgrade and then asking if I'd commit to breakfast everyday then and there for a ""special rate"". Having been travelling all day the last thing I needed was a lot of questions and when I declined to give me time to check the numbers the check in person pulled a face, as if I was offending him. I was also asked to preauthorise my card for the amount including breakfast, it was confusing and the check in person didn't adequately explain why. I even had to ask for him to slow down as I couldn't understand his accent. I was then told my room wouldn't have a single double bed but would have to be two singles pushed together. The alternative was for me to pay for an upgrade. I asked NOT to have this, but when I arrived at my room I found I did actually have two beds pushed together. The porter was in my room and seemed to think he'd get a tip just for pushing beds together. When I made it clear he wouldn't he left without showing me how anything (tv, ac, lighting controls) worked.The breakfast was very good, but for £20 it should be. I did notice restaurants along the same street selling breakfast for a fraction of that cost. The hotel was very plush, very clean and the open air pool was lovely. My room was massive and the views were outstanding. It's very well connected (opposite Emirates Tower metro) just over the footbridge. So it made travelling around simple. I bought a red Nol card for 20 DRM (£4) each day which took me all over the city. The area around the hotel has a lot of places to get supplies, Wagamamas, Burger King, Costa, a supermarket and pharmacy to name a few.When I checked out again I had more frustration as I was presented a different rate (my 3rd rate) differing to my preauthorised amount. When I asked why the lady explained, but it still wasn't clear. Again the manor I received didn't help, again I had to ask for it to be explained slowly due to her accent. Ultimately I was presented with two costs. Which in hindsight cost me about £30. I just wanted to pay the agreed rate I'd booked but no one could explain adequately in English what I was paying for, and I couldn't be bothered to debate it any longer as I had a plane to catch. To add insult to injury the airport courtesy car mentioned (when I booked) wasn't anything other than a local cab. I felt that was consistent with my experience of my stay. To be honest it was a lovely hotel, with great views and I had a beautiful room. My room cleaner and the breakfast staff were genuine and helpful people. But my over riding thoughts of my stop were I felt the hotel were constantly trying to get money from me one way or another and no one spoke strong enough English to explain why. I also heard another English man checking in having the same issue with rates so it wasn't just me. In summary with so many other hotels in the same stretch of road I wouldn't stay here again or recommend it sadly", 5 December 2015,"London, United Kingdom10169",not fake

gazlough,A fantastic hotel!,"Probably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! That is a big statement to make but I really did enjoy my 5 nights here. In rating any hotel the first consideration for me is always it's most valuable asset - staff. They were excellent. Very friendly & always helpful. It costs nothing to smile & greet customers with a ""good morning etc"". The company should be proud of their employees. Hotel location is excellent. Situated on the main Dubai artery - Sheik Zayed Road - with the hotel entrance approx 5 metres from the Emirates Towers Metro (yes....metres! It is that close!).Although we did not dine here I checked out the menu available & the selection of food on offer was extensive at fairly reasonable prices. I was located on the 43rd floor & upgraded to a premium room free of charge upon check in which obviously added to my positive experience. I also asked if I could get access to the 61st floor premium lounge to take some photos of the Dubai skyline - this was not a problem & I was admitted without any hassle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for good value in a very comfortable, classy hotel with friendly & welcoming staff.

It was 15 minutes by taxi from the airport, 10 minutes from mall of dubai 15 minutes from mall of emirates and 20 minutes from jumeirah beach area! The hotel was absolutely fandastic the staff was all the time with a smile and happy to help you anytime for anything.

Calvin L,Great value!,"This is a great hotel offering fairly reasonable price. I really don't understand why there have been so many unfair cynicism towards its service and staff, but my experience is really telling me that it is a smart and comfortable choice if you want a hassle-free business trip. The room is very neat and smartly featured, and the location is brilliant on the Sheikh Zayed Road which connects everywhere in Dubai. The staff crew is really helpful and they were really efficient in responding to my need. Indeed, this hotel is a bit parsimonious if you expect a total chill-out experience-but who will expect that sort of experience on Sheikh Zayed Road? Again, ideal for business trip, great value, and really straightforward.", 2 December 2015,"Brighton, England, United Kingdom",not fake

The Metro restaurant offers a sumptuous breakfast buffet. You have free access to the pool in the next building. The reception staff are extremely courteous and the overall decor and ambiance at the hotel is fantastic! I was lucky to have a large room and had a very comfortable stay. However, if you are staying long term for a week or so, then the room does not have certain kitchen amenities like microwave.Overall this is a great hotel, and situated right adjacent to the Emirates Tower metro station.", 2 December 2015,"Bengaluru, India",not fake

mountain2005,Wonderful the 2nd time around!,"This is my 2nd time at Millennium Plaza, having stayed here a year ago. Last minute plans, but I knew the hotel was near the DIFC and was opposite the MRT. Anyway, when I checked in I was asked if I wanted to change my reservation from 2 single beds to a King sized, and even though it was a smoking room I took it. The room at least in comparison, was a lot more comfy than I thought, and the view was of the beach which was a nice change than the city view I normally get. So waking up to the serene views was nice.I then had to hastily arrange for a meeting room, and managed to secure a room at the Club Lounge. What made it nice was that since I booked the lounge meeting room, they extended my room till 6 to allow me to freshen up before flying back. And the people were constantly checking to see if things were ok with the room, and the lounge receptionist was very friendly and attentive.It's little things like this that stand out for me - and will definitely recommend this place to everyone", 28 November 2015,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",not fake

BigT304,Great service,"We arrived quite early and the receptionist was very helpful and cheerful. We were very pleased to find out that they have a room for us for early check in. The room is very spacious and bathroom is quite large. It has separate shower and bath tub. Air conditioning is really good, probably too good as adjusting the temp higher seems futile. Free in room wifi is adequate although is a little restrictive that it is limited to 2 devices. I assume most people travelled with more than 1 device now so that is quite inconvenient as even if you turned off one device, it takes a long time before the system recylced and allowed another device to log on. Concierge service is really good especially on checkout. We had the luggage stored and our luggages retrieved and delivered to the taxi. Well done and great to find good service in Dubai!!!", 28 November 2015,"Sydney, Australia",NOT FAKE

It is close to Deira and close to Bury Dubai. Taxis are available all the time and it's close to a bus station too. Also there's a supermarket, a pharmacy, a clinic and different kind of restaurants all within 2-3 minutes walk. PRIME location.The Metro restaurant serve breakfast from 5 in the morning till 11Excellent buffet that has variety of food to suit everyone's taste. Kashif is one of the people who are there to help all the time. The area is clean the restaurant is lovely,airy and fresh.Not a bad smell that would ruin your morning suit. The windows are big so the are is sunny and bright. EXCELLENT place to have a morning meal.There are more than three elevator so you don't have to wait for a long time Which is important since this hotel is 65 floors!I tried room service twice and they were quick no complaints on that side.I had an issue when I first came with my AC and my TV which was sorted in 15 minutes they're very prompt and a very courteous .The engineering staff are excellent in fact all the staff of this hotel are fantastic the concierge Shafi3ie, Bishnu, and all the rest that I cannot remember their names.The security guys Victor,Cyril and Innocent all of them were courteous vigilant and well groomed.The reception staff Faiz and all the rest too.The duty managers in the Nabil Nizar Mohamed Arun Joseph were all fantasticIn fact the best thing in the hotel is its staff.I thank them all and I will definitely recommend this hotel for anybody! !!", 20 November 2015 ,bahrain,not fake

One of the most convenient locations in Dubai given it was very central to all the places we had to visit. The Emirates Towers Metro Station is 5 seconds away from the hotel which is just a godsend after a tiring day touring the city. Finally, there are a dozen dining options in the same row as the hotel if you're not a big fan of eating at the hotel. Also has a very decent infinity pool with a decent view of the city.

BoZaid_3s4,Great hotel,"Starting from the location the metro station (which will take you to many great attraction and malls) entrance is just in front of the hotel front door you have a lot of resturant nearby, supermarkets (24/7) so if you ever need anything it will be in a less than 5 min. Walking distanceOver all the hotel is very clean, the staff are very friendlly and helpful, parking is available for free and valet parking is free, I didn't use the gym but my friend enjoyed working out there, the swimming pool is great and even for non-swimmer you can head there to relax,I haven't tried their spa nor resturant.The rooms are spacious and relaxing, although I feel that it need more lighting, my room was facing the city (lovely view, & you can see burj khalifa), you can trust the fridge to cool your drink, I enjoyed the bathtub were you can open a window and watch some TV while relaxing, the bathroom also has a rain shower, the TV is set in the centre of the room and you can rotate it to watch from you bed, sofa or as I mentioned earlier from your bath tub room service is excellent and fast, the club sandwich was delicious and their juices will end your thirst and get you refreshed.I have to say, the only thing I hated is that they will not allow you to connect any external source to the TV. Well you can connect it but they have a setting which will automatically change the channel to their own port (HDMI 1). And their remote controller is pretty much limited.So if you dont use the tv or you are not picky about what to watch then you are fineAs for me I like to watch my own collection Another bad point is that WiFi is not free. Thus it was already included in my booking fares. But in this times where our life is around the internet. I would prefer hotels to include the wifi free of charges and even when the internet fare is already included with my room It was only limited to 2 devices.I was staying alone and already have 3 devices that need Wifi connection so if you have a partner in the room. I feel there will be a problemBut never the less I wouldn't mind staying there again and I know I will enjoy my stay there .",07-Nov-15,"Kusadasi, Turkey",NOT FAKE

Jenine was kind enough to give me a room on the 47th floor, which gave me a magnificent view of the city. My room is neat and equipped with modern room controls. Worth mentioning is tub - placed right beside the huge glass window panel - gives the most relaxing bath experience. Gym is really clean with top of the line equipment and a friendly club attendant. Wide variety of food in the buffet. Price- reasonable enough considering that this is a five star hotel. Special mention to Bea, who greeted and smiled at me whenever I passed by the lobby area.

Would stay here again 100% if not with family and got the same price. The Good: The staff, breakfast, view, and location (opposite metro door) are amazing. The Bad: The state of bathroom which needs maintenance. Some of the plastic on the glass door and stains on the floor and in bathtub. The Ugly: nothing I would classify as a red line issue on this trip. Tips for visitors: book a high room for the best views. Book early for good rates. Come down early for breakfast as it gets busy. Tips for the hotel: Take more care in the maintenance of the bathroom.

Yemisi A,Very Pleasant Stay,"We (children and I) stayed at this hotel for 6 days and we had a pleasant experience. Although the only downside was that I had pre-booked a room with twin beds, but when we got to the room we found that we had a room with just 1 king size bed. When I enquired at reception about this, I was told they didn't have any available. It would have been better if I had been told this when I was checking in at the Reception downstairs. So there was a bit of lack of attention to detail in that respect. And another issue we encountered was that it took so long to get hot water running in the bath and I had to call down to reception one occasion to complain about it. An engineer was sent to check and the explanation given was that because we were on the 52nd floor, it was taking a while for the water to heat up. I thought that was a fair enough explanation, but would have loved to have instant hot water.Overall, other than the minor hiccups, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The staff were helpful and friendly and the food was alright. Although I would have loved to see separate food/menu for the kids as my 9 year old found some of the food a bit too grown up for her palate.I liked the fact that hotel is right outside the Metro station and next to a supermarket and also next close to a variety of shops and it made it very easy for us to get around. The kids enjoyed using the pool which was situated on the roof of the car-park and we had very lovely views from our room on the 52nd floor.",16-Sep-15,"Beckenham, null, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

We had to go back in lobby and sit there to get our room key, which was given to us around 5pm and when went to room, it was still being cleaned up. Which means front desk was lying all along that room has been ready and some housekeeping manager is unavailable who is suppose to final check the room and give the key to us.

The hotel had excellent customer service as you can see from our reviews with warm welcoming and polite friendly staff always offering to help at all times. Breakfast was pretty good with excellent choice of breakfast.We decided to choose a different hotel for our Anniversary something closer to the local shops, mall and other amneties so we were told about the Millennium Plaza Hotel which we thought its a 5* hotel and location looks great. We were told they had a special offer of a free upgrade so we will be given a superior room rather than a standard premium room. We also adv them our flight was an early flight so we will need to check in early as we were coming from Bali and our flight got to Dubai early morning. We also adv them we were celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversay and if they can make it special for us to celebrate our time in Dubai.

The only negative point are the plug sockets which were not fitting with our european plugs (only one in the room).The breakfast is excellent, there is a big choice to find.The location is perfect, directly near the emirates towers station from which you can get easily to everywhere. The staff is very friendly and helpful.One big minus is that the wifi is only free in the lobby, we paid 50Dh for 3 days and we could connect up to 3 devices. Of course this is not very expensive but in my opinion the wifi should be free everywhere in a 5star hotel! However we had a great stay.", 3 September 2015 ,N/A,NOT FAKE

Andrew W,A welcome and restful break,"What felt like an eternity after leaving New Zealand, we arrived at Dubai airport at 7am. A relatively short taxi ride into town brought us to our stop-over hotel - Dubai's Millenium Plaza. Walking into the air conditioned foyer was a pleasant relief as the Concierge dealt with our luggage. Contrary to our expectations our room was available immediately.We had decided at the 24 hour stop over would be restful and elected to spend the day in the hotel. The recreational facilities were excellent, in particular the roof-top swimming pool.As we had just gone through an 8 hour time difference, we were grateful that our meals were fine and available as and when we wanted them: gluten-free diet well catered for.Staff were obliging throughout and there was no difficulty in getting to the airport an early morning departure as the hotel provided the transport: similar cost to a taxi.If you want an oasis of rest following a long flight, this hotel fits the bill.", 3 September 2015,"Wellington, New Zealand",NOT FAKE

adam456618,Comfortable and Excellent Stay,"This hotel was fantastic from the get go. The rooms were splendid, comfortable, clean and well air conditioned. One slight nag is that the windows from the outside were very dirty but that didn't surprise me due to being in the desert and the sand however it would have been nice for it to be clear. The breakfast was very enjoyable and had a lot to offer for people of different tastes. All our needs were attended to very promptly without hesitation. One negative was that the lifts at times took very long to come to the floor this was noticeable at breakfast times when many people were queuing for lifts. In the lobby the staff were attentive and when they saw us walk in they would call for lifts and hold doors open.The location of the hotel is fantastic right by the metro station so you could go to anywhere in a heartbeat. The views from the room were splendid and the outdoor swimming area is fantastic.When we were leaving we phoned concierge and they took all our luggage down waiting for the taxi and even helped put it all in which was fantastic. Staff were definitely 5* A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT to RIYAZ the bell boy from the moment we got there he attended to all our rooms placing luggage on the holders and explaining the features of the rooms and what to do when needed something. He was a knight in shining armor well mannered and whenever he saw us asked if he could help us with anything. So Thank You Riyaz.",02-Sep-15,"London, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

devilsdr,Best staff I ever came across in any hotel in my history of travel.,"This was my second stay in Millennium Plaza after my stay here in January, it has been an year for travel for me and I have stayed many places elsewhere and in Dubai but have never felt so much at home as I have been here during my 4 day stay.The Hotel has improved lot since my last feedback, all the concerns have been addressed perfectly like the hot water issue and the air conditioning. My check in this time was very smooth and quick and I was in room within minutes, The premium room is spacious and very comfortable, the sound proofing is better than I encountered before, I had issues with amenities last time but they have addressed that too, now they have almost everything in standard to the five star rating. House keeping was very alert and quick to entertain my requests even when I requested a room make over late night.As I mentioned above, what really made this hotel stay outstanding was the staff who were always there when I needed something or had to extend or anything else. Mr. Muhammad at guest relations is the most informed and alert person I have come across, he is an asset for the hotel. The others I like to mention with great appreciation is Razi at concierge desk and Keshav. There was one more guy at the Valet parking at night who used to take my car and he was very good too. There is nothing this professional staff does wrong. Finally I would like to mention Mr. Gayeth through whom I made the booking, he is always very co-operative.The breakfast buffet in Metro is highly improved, didn't visit the pool and gym so can't comment, Coffee in the lobby is really A-class. The only area the hotel needs to improve is the room service, the food I ordered was really very average.I will definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to my friends, everyone has own preferences when they look for a hotel, SZR area is the best place to stay in Dubai if you are looking for a more shopping and night life type of stay rather than resort type, this hotel is at the heart of Dubai and with staff like that, you won't be wrong by staying here.", 1 September 2015,"Farwaniya, Kuwait",NOT FAKE

BradWPerth,Truly brilliant service and a comfortable stay,"My wife and I stayed for one night at the Millenium Plaza in Dubai, as part of a 24hr stopover en route to Europe. Having arrived very early from Perth, we went to the hotel, very conveniently placed immediately next to a Metro station, fully expecting to have to wait several hours to check in. The night manager was still on duty when we checked in, and was absolutely delightful. He spared no effort to get us straight into our room so we could shower and rest. The room included breakfast, however as we would be checking out too early for breakfast the following day, he offered for us to have it on the first day, after checking in. The room (Superior King) was not one of their premium suites, but was prefect for us. It was spotless, well appointed with a king sized bed, and had a very nice bath and shower. The large window offered a sweeping 38th-floor view towards the city. The breakfast restaurant, although very busy, was fine, and the food was good, with fresh omelettes cooked to specification. All staff, from the manager to the porters and waitresses went out of their way to be friendly and helpful, and in respect of their service, I would rate the hotel as high as any in which I have stayed. The room was very comfortable, well air conditioned and completely quiet.", 29 August 2015,Perth,NOT FAKE

Shower and was quite good as well. Service was fine also . The main issue was the rush at the restaurant during the break fast time. The place is too small for such a huge hotel. Consequently, there were long queues of omlate seekers. Had to wait long for the check in . Tough my arrival time was after mid night but normally at crowded hotels they have additional staff when there is rush on the counter . The building is more than 50 floors. The speed of elevators was comparatively slower .Besides, waiting time was also . I think they should consider having new type of lifts where the floors are allocated .so that not all lifts stop at all destination. Reaching the conference rooms area of the hotel was also a jigsaw puzzle. There were no sign on the elevators or directons.", 27 August 2015,Karachi,NOT FAKE

But to my disappointment when we arrived in the room part of the mini bar has 2 tubs of peanuts!!! Being part of a club suite you get access to the club lounge (6 1st floor). All the cakes/snacks contained nuts which we could not eat due to allergy. So its a bit of wasted money for us. The staff said that we could get something from room service instead. When we phoned nobody seemed to be able to give us an answer as to whether or not we could get something which is disappointing.Also when we arrived we were told that the hotel pick up car had been waiting on the wrong day!

onemoderngirl,Terrible for a business traveler,"I did not feel comfortable here. I am a business traveler and this was one of the worst hotels I ever stayed at during my work trips. I stayed for 10 days during Ramadan. Now granted, Ramadan is not the best to be in Dubai, but this hotel did not make it any better. They would not allow me to change money at the front desk (she said she did not have enough for 100 USD!), the pastries in the lobby coffee shop are honestly the worst I have ever eaten, the cappuccino sucked, the pool was ok although the lifeguard told me not to drink out of my water bottle because it's Ramadan - there was an older British couple at the pool, me and the lifeguard. I highly doubt the British couple would care, and the Lifeguard was Indian.Further, the Wifi was terrible and kept kicking me out (anything over 2 devices, you have to pay extra for wifi), it took forever to check out, they overcharged me for both of my laundry services, and the gym was literally 40 Celzius in there. I complained about the gym at some point, they said they fixed it - well their fix was to keep the door to the gym open so there is some sort of a breeze. The breakfast was the worst - no taste, even the eggs were terrible. Who messes up eggs??? If you want hot water in the morning, you have to turn on all faucets in the bathroom - so the sink, shower, bathtub and bidet and leave them all on for about 15 minutes. Then voila, hot water is on.The only one positive was that the rooms are spacious and the cleaning services in the room were excellent.",10-Aug-15,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",NOT FAKE

The breakfast is amazing. The staff are extremely nice and helpful. It is like 10 mins by car to Dubai mall. More important, the Metro station is exactly on front off the hotel entrance.

Coriander D,Terrible Service Terrible Hotel,"Arrived at this hotel and they took our bags, saying they would be sent up to our room in due course. After over an hour waiting in the room, we called downstairs - they had no records of our bags. Not great as we were waiting for our clothes so we could go out for the evening. Eventually our bags were located in a cupboard and we brought them up to the room ourselves.I attempted to run the bath, but the water was cold, again i rang reception and was told to just let it run and it will turn hot eventually!! It took 15 minutes for hot water to come through. I would have thought water would be very precious in the middle of dubai but apparently not at this hotel.The kettle lead didn't fit into the wall socket! so I couldn't make any teaThe mini bar had no pricelist - maybe everything was free, but i doubt it!There was an ironing board in the room, but no iron- so again i phoned reception who brought up an iron which leakedI went downstairs to the cafe and ordered a cold sandwich to take away, they told me to sit down and wait and it took 20 minutes to put the sandwich into a box!Finally on my last day staying in this hole i got into a lift, pressed a button but none of the buttons would work, the lift started to move anyway at which point i noticed a sign inside of the lift saying 'Staff Use Only' - how about you put the sign outside of the lift? So I was trapped in the lift until it decided to stop on some random floor and let me outOur stay here was terrible, very stressful and not what i needed when i was pregnant",31-Jul-15,"London, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

Rooms were so clean and big and spacious with three girls we where dreading this as we never pack lightly but had plenty of room. The pool was under construction but the did not do work durning the day so the part they didn't work on was still beautiful and peaceful. Watching the sun set from the pool area is amazing too.

Patrick B,Superb Location. Excellent Rooms. Great service.,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night back in April. Having landed early in the morning from London A quick stress free metro ride led us directly to the door of this hotel! Very convenient. We were able to check in straight away (at around 8am) so we were able to get a few hours of sleep and freshen up before we headed out for the day- this really made our trip! The reception staff were always obliging, acting always in a professional and efficient manor! The room that we were given was simply incredible, it was on a high floor and faced down the Sheikh Zayed road - with great views to not only the Dubai skyline and Burj Khalifah but also to the Jumeirah beach. Breakfast was delicious, there was a lot of choice and great service! The pool area looked nice but unfortunately in our short stay we did not get to use it. One minor moan, the lifts took forever to reach the ground floor, they kept stopping and starting on practically every floor! we were on the 62nd floor! All in all we had a great trip, i would like to thank the whole team for making it such a stress free experience. I would recommend anyone stopping over in Dubai briefly to stay at this hotel.",28-Jul-15,"Exeter, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

Loksanchari,"Great service, excellent rooms, fab hotel","It was nice to go back to the Millenium Plaza having booked a room as a bed, breakfast and broadband deal directly through the hotel's website. The reception was friendly, polite and courteous - mind you I arrived just before midnight. Me and my partner were checked in without any problems . The concierge was attentive and prompt. The hotel reception area was clean as usual and accomodating.We were assured at the reception that our room on the 50th floor will be what I was looking for in terms of a 'strictly non- smoking ' room.I must say that we were very pleased with our room . The views facing the sea were also good. The recpetion were happy to change it to a room facing Sheikh Zayed Road the next day but we were so happy with the room that we continued our stay in room 5009.The wifi was excellent and did not have any trouble with the wifi at any point .The breakfast was good and had something for everyone in the menu including vegetarian and asian vegetarian food. The staff at the breakfast venue were organised, attentive, courteous and helpful. The quality of the food was excellent.The gym was ever so slightly upgraded from the last time I had been and I felt that it could do with more free weights that are heavier than just 20kg dumbells. The spa area was good but there was some repair going on in the men's room corridor- it wasn't much of an inconvenience.The pool area was clean and attended to.I would like to mention Lalit who was excellent with his manners and was ever so helpful by giving me his mobile to make an urgent quick call to India as my phone suddenly stopped working. Keshav at the concierge was very good with providing information about the hotel , metro etc.The room was meticulously cleaned every day - the guys from the house keeping were polite and flexible.This was an excellent experience for me and my partner. We could not fault anyone at any point though we felt there was one area that can be improved.Area of improvement:This is not just our feeling but also the feeling that was shared with us by other western guests who were dining at the breakfast table. There was queue for omlettes but there were a few Arab guests who would just go to the top of the queue without standing in the queue. The chef/chefs at the omlette place served them first and then only they served the other guests waiting in the queue though the other guests had been waiting for a while before the Arab guests. The staff should be able to ask them to stand in a queue just like anyone else . I belive everyone should be treated equally whether one is a local or a non local.", 27 July 2015,N/A,NOT FAKE

The bell desk was very prompt in sending me the bags and even took initiative to explain the room features . My room in the 53rd Floor was very nicely laid out , spacious , spacious bathrooms . My only observation was that the couch in the room had a hole must be caused by a cigarette burn . Since the room was close to the lift , every time the lift opens at the floor , the ""ting"" noise was very irritating as it was very much audible in the room . Imagine if you have a full floor occupied and the lift keep opening and closing through out, which was a not so good experience . The room Service was indeed very prompt and the service was very courteous . The food was excellent on both my orders . Breakfast was not at all impressive on both my night stay at this hotel . Service was not at all good . You had to wait for long to spot a waiter . The breakfast counters did not have enough plates and many of the guests including me was made to wait for long for plates after been told to a member of service staff . The long queues at the Egg counter was a put off. Food was good . They have a nice spread . I liked the salad section and the hummus tasted divine ! Will I return to this hotel ?

Instead were given a pastry in a paper bag on leaving. :( Couldn't understand why we didn't get room service as we had paid for the breakfast. Other people who stayed at Sheraton Dubai Mall received this service so that didn't go over well. Unfortunately only had 1 day so was a big rush to see the sites. Impressed with staff and ammenities.

We didn't expect it since we were using a travel agency tour and it was supposed to pay completely for our hotel. We asked, and the staff told us it's some kind of tax.- No liquor is served at this hotel. I feel bad for writing this as a con since the local rules are against liquor and most of Dubai hotels don't serve liquor, but we found only one hotel which had a bar.- Foods at the restaurant were mostly Indian foods with lots of pepper and spices and no drinks were served with lunch (except water).- Many things were chargeable (like internet or drinks at restaurant) and costed money at the end.", 10 June 2015,Dubai,NOT FAKE

The hotel shouild teach the guy basics how to talk with guests when your checking in they are very sweet and when checking out they think they did a favour on us.

Gilda M,My first trip to Dubai,"Millennium Plaza Hotel Dubai is a comfortable hotel , situated in the main street closed to metro station within easy access to any main places in city. Nearby are metro, restaurants, fast foods, super markets, drug store, disco and bike rentals. Food quality and the environment are great. The rooms are very clean and the staffs are very polite. There is a swimming pool where you can swim and rest under the sky...i think the main problem is the wifi which is not free for their tourism. i mean you should pay extra fee for using hotel's wifi. it is not good for a five stars hotel.the room lightening is low for evening and night. it is perfect for sleep. but you cannot see yourself in the mirror. it is a bit dark to see anything.I recommend you to try this hotel for your trip to duba", 7 June 2015,"Tehran, Iran",NOT FAKE

The hotel is close to the convention center--it is one metro stop from the convention center or a very short taxi ride. While at the hotel, we availed ourselves of the spa, room service, and restaurant services. The spa is exceptional. The room service fare was above average and, in some cases, exceptional. Our highest commendations go to the staff services. The staff provided exceptional service to us as we transported materials to and from the trade show. Without exception, we received 5 star service for our entire stay. Outstanding experience.", 6 June 2015,"Orem, Utah",NOT FAKE

matt b,3 day stop over,"Hotel reception very small but staff very good. Room nice with excellent view on 6th floor. Bath I'd massive. Gym was disappointing very large with lots of cardiovascular machines but poor selection of weights and no bars and limited machines. At least the should add a cable machine and plates bigger than 15kg. The dumb bells go up to 20kg.Also there is no control at gym reception people just walk in. While I was working out a group of 8 people 4 kids walked in with street shoes and clothes jumped on machines and let the kids run riot with the gym balls. Did 10 minutes and left all the balls everywhere and not a staff member in sight. Does the hotel have gym insurance for 4 year old? ?Let's hope the next 2 days get better.The Friday dinner selection was Indian night and very poor we did a quick tour and left as it was well below what we are used to in Dubai and particularly on a Friday.", 6 June 2015,N/A,NOT FAKE

Richard C,Excellent 5* hotel for the price (booked via independent),"Have just returned from a 3 night break in Dubai with my family. This hotel is a very good value 5* hotel (obviously if you book at the best rates) Service: our flight landed at 7.30am, we arrived at the hotel at around 9am and was greeted and the hotel managed to arrange an early book in at around 11,30am. In the meantime the hotel let us use the spa changing room and roof top pool to fresh up and relax whilst awaiting our room keeping our luggage safe too. Everyone in the hotel is extremely polite and any room request (towels / extra water / pillows) were accommodated .Room: The room was immaculate and large, we had a sea view on the 50th (which I requested a high floor) and had an amazing view especially at sunset. Breakfast: The breakfast was included in our rate and you could really have what you wanted, they catered for most nationalities and normally this would last my family until supper.Wi-Fi: Wifi is at a fee, but its 50D (£10) for 3 days which 2 devices could be logged onto. It was extremely fast and I wouldn't complain as other hotels I have stayed in charge £15 a day and was slow.The hotel is also dry, which wasn't really a problem as beer / wine is expensive in Dubai (£10 pint / glass) and it was nice to have a break from the stuff, expecially with the heat. We did have some takeaway mocktails which were very nice £5 each.A couple of negatives which didn't bother us but may for some. One of the days we stayed was extremely busy and I didn't feel the hotel could cope in the breakfast area, clearing up, tables etc... Also there are 5 lifts covering 60 floors, so again on a busy day around 8-10am the lift is like a metro train, only when full it travels direct!Finally the reception area doesn't do the hotel justice, its a bit too clinical and there isn't the relaxing bar / sofa area with darken lights like other hotels. Its all a bit like a work canteen. I did nose around on the 60th floor lounge and they could convert that into a lovely bar area with amazing views around dubai.For what we used the hotel for was excellent so I can't complain. The location is great as you have a taxi rank and metro just outside.",29-May-15,"Leicester, United Kingdom",NOT FAKE

Hanan A,Beyond Expectation,"It is one of the great hotels in the area. 1st the hotel is very well located. In a road that everything is available at a walking distance and on top of this the metro station is just across the road. You can go places with no difficulty at all. Great Location. The staff at that hotel are amazing. They want to help in any way possible. They are friendly always smiling great team. When I enter that hotel from a long trip I feel the comfort of a family atmosphere. They make you smile and facilitate as much as possible. Reception team concierge, security, team at the restaurants housekeeping are amazing. If you are a regular customer like me then you will find even your personal choice is well attended and known to the staff. That hotel staff spoil us. We also carry out training in the training facilities...great team attend to our training requirements there as well. They make sure that your requirements are met to your satisfaction. One important thing that I do not find in any hotel else is lost and found. If you forget anything in the room or you forget anything in the restaurant or any where else in the hotel, be sure they will get it back. If you forgot anything in the room it will be well kept. Another last thing, the millennium plaza innovate and change. Continuously change to the better.

BennSophie,"6/10 - Good But Not Great, No Alcohol Allowed, Pool Average","The Millennium Plaza Hotel located on Shiek Zayad Road (About a 5 minute Taxi ride from the Dubai Mall and Burj Kalifa) was a friendly, clean and very respectable hotel for anyone staying in Dubai for a few days or taking a short holiday. Centrally located the millennium plaza hotel is comfortably close to 'downtown Dubai', has easy access to the gold and spice suiks of old Dubai and can be easily accessed via the Dubai Towers Metro located out the front.We caught the Metro from the Airport at a cost of 16 AED ($5.00 USD, for the two of us and got there in 15-20 minutes without the need for a transfer). The hotel is satisfactory with a decent pool and friendly staff but lacks the decadence you expect from an upmarket Dubai hotel.Serviced daily the millennium plaza has everything you would expect from a quality hotel and typically good views of Dubai to boot.The breakfast is expensive at 109 AED ($33 USD) per person, and the hotel is 'dry', meaning there is no alcohol available. But despite this, value and quality are there. Overall a 6/10.", 14 May 2015,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",NOT FAKE

The room was fantastic Big bathroom amazing and the TV channels excellent choice for us English. The view across to the islands was amazing. The hotel is a dry which was no issue for us as if you wanted a drink hotels all around you with in minutes walk that sell alcohol. Good little supermarket next door so stock up on snacks and cold drinks. Breakfast :- breakfast was not that good, a god choice of breads and stuff but not may hot dishes and no pork so was a bit of a let down for me compared to other hotels in Dubai. As i said service was excellent they looked after our bags after checkout so we could later as flight was in middle of the night. Staff very friendly and did an excellent job keeping place clean. So except breakfast only other let down was internet this was suppose to be a business hotel you got free internet in the lobby but had to pay per room and per item. I was going to return to this hotel and i would when they sort out the internet issues till then i will use a near by hotel that has free internet. andit seem sin other reviews this is peoples main gripe.Did not have tiem to look at pool/gym but looked very good. So more hot stuff for breakfast and free internet and u have a top hotel.

The room was sensational, a huge bed, separate lounge/business area and a great big ensuite. The thing that impressed us mostly was that as we were due to fly out at 6am, we would miss breakfast, so they gave us a breakfast hamper to take to the airport.

Rayoody88,"A great location, a great view and friendly staff.","I stayed there two nights. I arrived at 4:30 AM..they apologized and said they can only let me check in after 6:30 AM which is completely understandable. I was coming from a flight from Phuket Thailand.. So I decided to walk to a cafe next door which is open 24/7 ( most restaurants, cafes and stores are open 24/7 in Sheikh Zayed Road. when I cameback, they apologized again and offer me an upgrade, free wifi and also free breakfast. I appreciated it. And by the time of check out, I woke up too late for my flight and I told the reception that I'm late, she made sure she makes my check out so fast which it was and appreciated .Tip: this hotel faces the metro station. Its centrally located and the room is huge.Tip: they dont have free shuttle service except to the Outlet Mall.", 3 May 2015,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",NOT FAKE
